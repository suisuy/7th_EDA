"February 15, 2020","I really like how nice and simple it is but I need help... Everytime i go to sleep (for the past 3 days) i charge my phone, and put it beside me and click 'start sleep'. The music plays and i fall asleep. in the morning, i check it and the alarm is on the screen so I stop it.. BUT i go to check my sleep but it tells me... That i need ""at least 30 minutes of sleep to have a record blah blah""??? i slept for 8+ hours???? Its been saying the same thing for the past 3 nights (-_- )halp",3
"January 19, 2022","The app is always improving, and the developers listen to my advice. In latest updated version, I see the snore tag for some of my sleep recordings. Good! It feels like I'm growing with it, my sleep is getting better and it's getting better and more powerful. It feels so amazing. Been using it since 2020, the sleep reports are great, I also learned how bedtime behavior can affect sleep, and now I don't drink alcohol before bed. Many thanks to the developers, you guys are awesome.",5
"January 19, 2022","I like Sleep Monitor very much. Of course, I have used other sleep monitoring software, and finally found Sleep Monitor to be more suitable for me. The music in the app is very nice, and it is very helpful for my sleep. I hope to update more sleep music. I suggest adding some children's sleep music. The sleep results are also very credible, I got up a few times at night and the reports showed it all. Does everything needed and has no hidden fees. This app is perfect and I love it!",5
"January 20, 2022","Nice app, I found value and good information. I've been paying more attention to my sleep this year and have seen a lot of benefits when I'm consistent with my sleep. I knew about rem sleep but I had no idea why I have it 2-3 times every night . I love informative app like this! Thanks...The tips to help get to sleep are spot on, everytime I open a book I fall asleep after the first 4 or 5 pages. It's as good as a sleeping pill..I was only able to read The Odyssey 4 or 5 pages at a time..lol",5
"January 19, 2022","A very nice way to know my sleep. App analyzes my my sounds, movement, and behaviors as I sleep to give me a clear snapshot of the duration and quality of my sleep. I like that it gives me a sleep score to measure how well I slept and provides me with an in-depth analysis based on length of my sleep. This app also helps me determine how much time I spend in a dream (REM) and how many times I am disturbed throughout the night. Although the data accuracy cannot reach100%, say it at least 90%.",5
"January 19, 2022","Really impressed with analytics. Have used other sleep apps but this is by far the best. Sleep reports can be viewed every day. The operation is very simple, I click to start monitoring before going to bed and turn off monitoring in the morning. Then I can see my sleep report. The design of the app looks very comfortable, very close to the feeling of sleep. You can use the recording for free, but you must know that the recording function is charged in other apps. I have been using it for a few weeks and it is still very good. I recommend downloading it.",5
"January 20, 2022","Nice informative app. I use to sleep so very deeply and loved it, but not anymore due to health reasons. Is it “normal” to wake up after deep sleep stage? Or easier to be woken up? I seem to wake every 2-3 hours at the same time most nights. Usually I take a quick bathroom break then fall back asleep usually without issue. Is this something I need to address or normal?",5
"January 19, 2022","I have no complaints here. App does the best job of helping me improve my sleep. It allows me to set sleep goals for reaching them. It also provides more detailed sleep-stage data than most other apps, its smart alarm did a pretty good job of waking me up slowly, so I felt less groggy. The free version provides general sleep records for seven days at a time. For $20 a year, Sleep Monitor tracks and records sleep reasonably accurately for the long term.",5
"January 19, 2022","Sleep Monitor shows how long i were in each stage of sleep(light/deep/REM/awake). This app’s clean graphs let me easily see general trends—which is almost all i need to understand my patterns. I also love that it has more than a dozen smart-alarm sounds and lulling sounds to choose from to aid sleep, so getting up and going to bed both feel a lot more pleasant. Why not give me some advice for improving sleep? If I have low sleep quality, there should be a way to fix it. That would be perfect.",5
"January 19, 2022","I’ve tried so many well-regarded and reviewed sleep apps, but this is the one which helped make a difference—and continues to do so. From understanding that my sleeping quality low high to seeing the impact of food, alcohol, and other activities, I am now in control of this essential health component. I recommend this app for anyone wishing to understand their sleep and make changes to improve health. Love seeing hours of deep sleep now and all the rings closed.",5
"January 19, 2022","I used two sleep monitoring software at the same time and found that Sleep Monitor was more accurate. It gives me a me a lot of my sleep insights and it helps improve it! I coughed at 3am at night, then got up and poured water, only the Sleep Monitor recorded it, I heard my cough in the recording, and saw the state of waking up in the report. Incredible. I am considering becoming a member. I have a small suggestion, I wish the notifications of sleep reminders were a bit more visible so I wouldn't forget to monitor.",5
"January 20, 2022","This small app gives me a lot info about my sleep quality and it helps improve it! Of course i‘m going premium! I'm concerned about myself as I only get deep sleep at the beginning of the night in a 1-2 sleep cycles which is roughly around 1h45 mins a night? I'm 24 years old, keep fit and healthy and try to get to bed at good timing but why am I only getting deep sleep at the 1/4 of my sleep? Never any after that! I will keep tracking if my deep sleep duration will be longer later.",5
"January 19, 2022","I've spent more than a month spent testing four popular sleep-tracking apps (along with a range of wearables). I found this Sleep Monitor Android app has an uncomplicated interface with an intuitive design, I recommend. This app offers objectively accurate sleep analysis, although app can’t replicate the experience of a traditional sleep lab, but we can use the collected statistic to lean trends and patterns, which may help improving our sleep over time. Very simple to use app.",5
"January 20, 2022","I would give 10 stars if I could. I had sleeping problems but this app helped me to find a regular sleep rhythm even without the premium upgrade. I should be getting 7-9 hours of sleep but I only get around 4-5 maximum. This has been incredibly informative. I see my REM sleep info. I was wondering do you know what stage people are in when they sleepwalk? How can you prevent nightmares? App is good to show data, but tips to improve sleep are also valuable. Hope dev can add some tips later.",5
"January 17, 2022","I have been using Sleep Monitor continuously for almost two weeks. Sometimes I forget to turn on sleep monitoring at night, which causes me to miss some reports. The overall design makes me feel very comfortable, and at least it doesn't look dazzling at night. Recording, alarm clock, sleep monitoring are all free. Music can also be unlocked by watching video ads. Perfect for someone who is not very wealthy like me! Hope the app gets better and better!",5
"January 17, 2022","I love this app. I bought it a long time ago and occasionally uses it, but the last couple of months I’ve been using it almost every single day. It really helped me get insight into my sleeping habits and what things positively and negatively influence my sleep. I do wish I had some tools to edit the end result of a night of sleep. Like manually setting my sleep quality afterwards! or setting the time I actually woke up. I like tiny sleepdiary/note taking section so you can write down relevant info for that night’s sleep would also be really nice to have (as a premium feature)",5
"January 17, 2022","Every morning I can't wait to open the app and listen to the recordings at night. I didn't know I was snoring or talking in my sleep before, but now I can actually hear it through the recording. It's an amazing feeling. The graphs in the sleep report are clear, but a small suggestion: pink is for REM, which should give an explanation or tip. I didn't know until I asked customer service. Overall great!",5
"January 17, 2022","The data from the sleep report is still pretty accurate in my opinion. I can know how long I slept at night. I also learned about sleep patterns. I know that sleep has deep sleep, light sleep, and yes, REM. Sleep music is also quite helpful for me and I love it. Christmas music is also prepared for Christmas, which is so heartwarming! I really like it. Hope the developers continue to work hard!",5
"January 17, 2022","I can't believe I was singing in my dreams at night. too crazy. I recommend everyone to try this app, you will learn about yourself at a deeper level. The information of the sleep report is very detailed, what time did you fall asleep, what time did you wake up, what did you do before going to bed, etc. Another function is the alarm clock, which is also very useful. Wake me up when I'm in a light sleep depending on my sleep situation. well done!",5
"January 19, 2022","Better healthcare than GOV insurance! I am interested in, and really need to know, how I'm sleeping. This app does that job for me. After several months' tracking, I get to know I wasn’t sleeping like I should and needed help to increase my sleep. Now I’m getting enough quality sleep consistently. You won’t be disappointed. The cost of Sleep Monitor Pro for a yearly commitment, costs almost the same as 1 cup of coffee. I strongly believe it is very well worth the investment.",5
"January 17, 2022","Sleep reporting is accurate. I am a huge fan of this app. Had used other apps before and finally settled on it for many reasons. The design is very user-friendly and the operation is very simple. Start monitoring before going to bed at night, and you can see the results in the morning. I was surprised to find that I was singing in my dreams at night, and I was shocked. Recordings are free to use. I've bought the pro now though and it's perfect!",5
"January 17, 2022","Great for monitoring my sleep. I didn't sleep well before, but I found this app when I browsed the play store. On the first day of downloading, I forced myself to go to bed early, lol. The next day, I was surprised to find that the app gave a lot of information, such as deep sleep, light sleep and so on. I didn't know these things before. So , thanks to Sleep Monitor, kind of enriched my knowledge base. Now I have good sleep habits, thank you!",5
"January 17, 2022","It has to be said that the app version is updated very quickly. I have already recommended it to my mother-in-law who doesn't sleep well, hope it helps. Tell something about my feelings. The data is relatively accurate. I can understand the basic situation of my sleep, such as how long I slept, whether I woke up in the middle, etc. The interesting thing is that I can also record what I did before going to bed. The fly in the ointment is that the sleep trend analysis should be more comprehensive",5
"January 4, 2022","Very useful app. It records sleep time, sleep cycles, and sounds in the room, picks the best time in a half-hour range for the gradual alarm to sound, offers a variety of music to encourage sleep, and more. I'm not sure why it would be so effective at improving sleep, but it certainly has been. I give it a solid 5 stars.",5
"January 16, 2022","I give it a 9+ I have tried many of these type of programs. By far I like this one the best. I need to check out more of the sleep aid 'music' at this stage I would say I would like to have a larger range of Theta sounds. But, in all fairness I have not totally searched different lists. I've only had the app, less than one week. So far love it.",5
"December 27, 2021","Cool. Kinda weird I’m being recorded while I sleep, that’s new. But very interesting. i’ve been telling a lot of my friends about this, and the smart alarm feature is so useful! i can wake up without feeling really groggy sometimes compared to regular smartphone alarms. i think the only thing they can do better is detecting snoring a little better, sometimes it thinks another person a room away snoring is me. To be perfect, it needs to add the ability to track heart rate. I would recommend it.",5
"January 18, 2022",Dev. wrote back promptly to explain that I should NOT turn off app and then turn it on again after attending to interruptions. He said to just leave it on and sound will tell the 'bot when I'm awake. So this app got 2 more stars. I will update if other solutions work for me.,3
"January 17, 2022","I must recommend Sleep Monitor to you guys. My personal sleep habits are not very good, I often stay up late, sometimes even past 3am. I saw someone recommending a sleep monitoring app on youtube, and I tried to use it 3 times. I actually fell asleep at 10 o'clock in the evening just to read the sleep report. That's the magic of this app, you force yourself to go to bed early. When I woke up in the morning and saw my sleep report, it was so satisfying!",5
"January 17, 2022","Considering I’ve used this app for more than 200 nights, I can say that it’s one of my favourite apps to date! The data collected by this app is very helpful for me to know some of my health status. It also offers music like ranning sounds to help fall asleep faster. Good! Too bad that you need to pay for the full version, but hey; they gotta make money too! How can app developers make a living if they develop a totally free app? Would definitely recommend if you need an app to track your sleeping habits and want a nice and gentle alarm.",5
"January 17, 2022","For 696 nights I’ve been using the app. It is my most recommended app to others.The various functions make this app great/unique, the smart wake up, the audio recordings, the sleep records over time, the sleep music, the sleep trends, most of the features are not got hidden behind a paywall, like the majority of functions, over time. I now have to rely on this app's alarm app to actually wake up. I need the app to wake me up in a relaxed way — that’s it. Keep up good work, dev!",5
"January 13, 2022","It's a great app don't get the wrong! But I would reconsider having that statistics as a premium feature. I'm really sad that I can see how many average hrs I sleep. Another thing is the rating after you sleep. I think you should make it so it's 1,2,3,4 or 5 stars instead of the emojis. But there's not many adds, so overall it's a great app!",4
"December 31, 2021","So far a good app to track sleep. I've been using it for about 5 days now. I check my sleep report daily. It seems I'm in a good sleep mode recently(deep sleep more than 50% of the time), which is a good thing. This app even records my movements on the bed. The recording feature is totally free to use, not like some other similar apps, recording is a locked feature. So I'll continue to use it while it's free and then I'll make my decision as to whether or not to buy it.",5
"January 20, 2022","It's accurate and good. Has all of the features I want. I've just been having one issue, for the past few months, the alarm hasn't been working. My mom has been waking me up on time for work since my alarm doesn't work.",3
"January 7, 2022","Well worth the money - I use it every night! Here’s a simple test to demonstrate the clarity this app offers. Download Sleep Monitor and use it for a week or two to get a sense of your baseline. Next, simply watch the impact of something on your sleeping. Is the sleep score lower on the nights after you consume alcohol? Is it higher on the days you have a good workout? I found the feedback from thisapp to be much more tangible and certainly more motivating than all of the advice or warnings I’ve received from doctors, trainers, etc.",5
"January 18, 2022","I bought lifetime access for $30. Devs are responsive and helpful. Google Fit integration is coming; looking forward to it. But I'd like being able to add/edit entries. The Y axis on the graphs for sleep/wakeup times should be reversed: earlier times should be on top, later times bottom. These pics are misleading: there's no timeline UI like, ""You talked in a dream at 4:27 am."" Sometimes randomly loses all entries. Better price and UI than competitors; has potential, but also much to be desired.",3
"December 24, 2021","I was looking forward to getting the recordings of what I have been saying while asleep. However, when I woke up this morning to check out the recordings it didn't have any. It mistook my sleep talking and moving for being awake instead. While I do not think that this is a faulty on the app. I do suggest that it should record speaking even if it thinks the person is awake.",2
"January 7, 2022","I really love this app. This is a all-in-one sleep app that with many features packed together: 1. Records sleep 2. wakes me up feeling great 3. Helps with sleeping 4. Provids sleep stats which are interesting to see. Also, There's an option when we want to upgrade to premium, like yearly, monthly or weekly. Wow, I wish I knew about this app sooner. Very informative. Keep doing the great work!",5
"January 7, 2022","I like this app. It helps me track # of hours of sleep, deep sleep, # of hours awake at bedtime. It rates quality of sleep and provide trends. Like what experts say, it is important to get a healthy sleep, besides diet and exercise, and this is a great app for that.",5
"January 7, 2022","This app is the most accurate sleep tracker I have found. I run it simultaneously with other sleep apps and Sleep Monitor is the most accurate on picking up times that I am awake at night. I feel like it’s classification of deep, light and REM sleep are more accurate as well. But I wish that I can see heart rate and O2 levels as well. Great app.",5
"December 28, 2021","Most apps like this have always seemed too cheesy or like a scam, but I honestly like how this one works and tracks my sleep. You do have to pay for a subscription, but if your trying to track your sleep and improve it, this is worth it honestly.",5
"January 7, 2022",Provides valuable insight into my consolidated sleep health measurements. I thought that I didn’t sleep well last night but the sleep app showed just the opposite. Perhaps I was just dreaming that I was not sleeping. According to the app (I’ve been using for over half a year) I am sleeping better than ever. I hope that the app is telling me the truth and not just trying to keep me happy. What I am doing different is sleeping early and not wasting time watching Netflix movies.,5
"January 6, 2022","I have used this app for a few years. It works well enough with some oddities. Firstly, the sleep rating system fails to take the user's opinion and the apps information into account and just rates it willy nilly. The time frame used in trends is backwards. I get up at 0600 not 1700. The dates are off. Last night was Jan. 5th, it recorded at 17/11. My sleep ""debt/surplus"" ratio is completely backwards as I have insomnia.. At least it sometimes records night sounds...",3
"January 7, 2022",I really like this app. It provides great information and is reliable and super useful to plan when to sleep to get the most sleep for work. It particularly works for me now that I can quickly recharge my Android before bed and use this app all night with power still available in the morning. I like the detailed and comprehensive data and explanations this app provides. A big thank you to the Developers.,5
"December 27, 2021",This app is great but I didn't think it would catch me crying last night cause it was so quiet other than that it is an amazing app also good to know I don't snore 😅 Edit : the music was very nice but I was horrorfied my mom would come and yell at me cause it was really loud but I think she was enjoying it to 😂 (also I was not sad last night well maybe a little but I was crying because I was really sick ),5
"January 17, 2022","Works easy, gives me insight. Also read the emails with tips for better sleep. Very Helpful! Only minus I can find is that it also records mij partners snoring and puts it on my ‘account’. Can I suggest an option to ad a tag ‘not my snoring’ or something like that? Somehow being able to make those snoring numbers accurate. That would make this a ***** rating.Thanks!",5
"January 3, 2022","It's pretty inaccurate, especially when it comes to REM sleep. According to the app, I woke up a whopping 11 times during the night with no REM sleep, despite vividly dreaming multiple times during the night.",2
"January 14, 2022",I want to like this app and have the trial version at the moment but the ads are so persistent and difficult to remove i cant use it properly. The ads pop up very loud and ugly and i have to shut the app down to stop them. Then i lose the options.,2
"January 9, 2022","This one isn't really working for me. I know it takes me at least an hour to fall asleep most days and the tracker registers this as sleep time. It's not accurate and not sensitive enough for light sleepers. You can't edit each track, either, so all of my records are inaccurate.",3
"January 9, 2022","Best sleep app. I’m ADDICTED to tracking my sleep. I have sleep apnea, a CPAP and occasionally drink alcohol. It’s so validating to see how those things can impact your quality of sleep. You read about these things but tracking them takes it to a whole new level. Thanks for making this app! At first thought it would be tough to charge my phone during the day but turned out fine.",5
"January 18, 2022","There is a area to click on specific sounds like sleeptalk, snoring, pets, etc. but it doesn't work. Sounds only come up when all sounds is clicked. I wanted to be able to isolate specific sounds.",3
"January 20, 2022",Great app! Had me asleep in 3 min. After being bombarded with purchase requests I was too tired to actually figure out how the app worked.,3
"January 6, 2022","Doesn't seem very accurate, I have been using for 4 or 5 days, and according to this I rarely ever get REM sleep, one night that I slept great it told me I was awake for 6 hours.",3
"January 9, 2022","I don't know what the face emojis are meant to express, so I don't think I've been choosing the right one. And there's no option to change if I tap the wrong one. So, the app has been pointless so far. But it seems like it could have been useful.",3
"January 7, 2022","It’s really helped give me some insight into my sleep,not just length of time sleep, but sleep quality. This is actually easier to use. I’m amazed at this new technology.",5
"January 15, 2022",So far this app has been helpful and useful which is why I gave it four stars. I wish there was a little more personalization. If I could turn off the sleep sounds I'd give it five stars,4
"January 12, 2022",Galaxy note 9 -> only recorded 1 night of audios. After that it keeps showing no noise detected even though noise levels fluctuated amd i was woke up to pee... purchased this for a full year and I want my money back!,1
"January 10, 2022",I've been using this app on and off but quite regularly but one thing that slightly botheres me is that you have to pay for a lot of things. I dont mind but it does sometimes bother me.,4
"January 11, 2022",Amazing you can use whenever you want and it comes with a relaxing sound for everyone gives options of what you have none recently like caffeine or stress there's alarms recommended best app ever !,5
"January 20, 2022",a great app and its completely free like some other apps that you have to pay to listen to the recordings,5
"January 2, 2022",Very good but if you don't mind me saying I think it's glitching as it's not recording my rem for 2 days it's impossible I haven't had any rem in 2 days? Hahaha,4
"December 29, 2021",Absolutely great! Simple and easy to navigate! Beautiful aesthetic too. Super recommend.,5
"January 19, 2022",Woke up way too early and an ad blasted my partner awake. Couldn't find a way to turn down the sound but I liked it until this happened.,1
"November 24, 2021","This is the best sleep tracking app I have found. The information it provides is valuable and pretty deep. It takes some getting used to and exploring all of its features will be a learning curve, but at the end of the day, it’s robust and complete. The graphics and user interface are superb as well - Gives me an understanding of issue that effect my sleep allowing me to make slight life style changes that make a big difference. Very worthwhile!",5
"January 6, 2022","Disappointed in this app as I'm using it to try to figure out what may be influencing my poor sleep quality after a sleep study said I didn't have apnea. Dr said it could be habits or other health issues. Chose this app to track these things but you are unable to see what ""tags"" you've logged and how often. I don't feel like it tracks my sleep well after using it for over a month. Also found out that your subscription doesn't roll over if you get a new phone. Now I've lost my data to show my DR.",2
"November 23, 2021","I’ve been using this for YEARS, and it hasn’t let me down yet. I love every bit about it.. the alarms, different sleep tracking modes, the colorful reports and relaxing sounds to fall asleep to, being able to see and understand your sleep patterns, the list goes on and on!! To say that I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone is a huge understatement. Get the app, I promise you’ll love it just as much as I do!",5
"December 9, 2021","Sleep Monitor so far has been running fine for me. It works, tracks sleep with what seems to be surprising accuracy & doesn't crash. No issues to report & have just upgraded to the premium edition :) I've tried pretty much all of the sleep tracker alarm apps on the store that looked worth their while, and this is by far the most impressive! Beautiful design, simple and elegant and great for keeping track of my sleep patterns and waking me up elegantly in the morning. Keep up the good work!",5
"January 10, 2022","I like this app , I only wish I could zoom in on the time scale of the sleep pattern but other than that it's very good",5
"November 14, 2021",I was searching for an app to track my sleeping and I found your sleep monitor. I think your work is great. I feel like it’s kind of hit or miss with the sleep trackers on watches. I know I woke up for about an hour and during that time for some reason it said rem sleep. Don’t know why seein as I got up and went tot he bathroom and everything. But I think it generally can give a good picture of your sleep maybe?,5
"November 27, 2021","Seems like a good app, but almost everything needs a paid for subscription except the absolute basics. The app really couldn't have less free functionality without being totally useless. Plus it seems like every time you touch the thing it's trying to sell you that subscription, and I mean every click triggers it. I'll probably give it s couple more days out of curiosity then delete it.",2
"November 14, 2021","The app overall is helpful & easy to navigate. But no explanation of features & there's a lot u can't customize. •I want AM/PM but it only uses military time. •""Sleep duration"" isn't when u actually slept, that's when the monitor was on & that's misleading! Can't they change it to ""monitoring duration""? •In ""Record details"" u can't click on each section to expanded. Basically, you get all kinds of facts & figures w/no explanation of what it means, or how to interpret the data in each section",4
"December 12, 2021","The reason why I only give this one star is because of the limit of things that this app does. Firstly it doesn't record everything and there is a limit to how much audio is being recorded. Secondly, it has a limit to how long you can sleep before it stops recording, and finally, it is extremely inaccurate. Do not recommend installing.",1
"December 7, 2021","Just over 5 months ago, I downloaded this app, loved it, rated it 5 stars, and have used it close to every night since. Yesterday, the app needed redownloading to update (?) Is now a separate app (?) With no access to prior records (?) And I would have to pay to access the previous app or view my records (???). Terrible. Also the app now has a permanent notification if your alarm is turned on, which is baffling. I will be looking for another app if these issues aren't improved.",2
"November 29, 2021","I love my sleep monitor app! Been using it for years now and I do not use any other alarm. In the past, before sleep monitor, I remember often waking up to an alarm feeling very groggy and tired because I was woken up likely in the middle of deep sleep. Now with sleep monitor, I am only woken up on the lightest part of my sleep and I don’t ever feel that same kind of tired grogginess I use to feel with previous conventional alarms. It’s amazing. Total game changer and highly recommend!",5
"November 14, 2021","Wonderful to be able to track the quality of my sleep. It helps me encourage myself to go to bed earlier and I always feel better after getting a lot of deep sleep. I know fitness tracker has its own algorithm, and every night our sleep is determined by the same algorithm so we can compare our day to day sleep through that same algorithm, that's good enough information and statistic to be aware of our sleep data. Just have a try for your health.",5
"November 30, 2021","I love the amount of information that this app collects. On the days that I wake up with a headache I’ve always wondered if I snore or not, and there was no way to tell until now.This app lets you see in clear terms how much you snored the during night, how loud, and exactly when (what time) you snored. So as you try various remedies you can check their effectivenessImmediately in the morning when you wake up!",5
"November 15, 2021",Last night I had the weirdest outcome ever. Around 5 AM when I hit play it sounded like there was a bomb about to go off so then I looked at the next recording under it and it was straight up beeping the entire recording. like nonstop. then there was another sound and it sounded like if you were to be making a duck face and then blowing in air. then the beeping started beeping again. I am going to see what happens tonight to see if there was anything unusual or it was just myself.,5
"November 15, 2021","I’m loving this app and must for people who are interested in tracking their sleep. One suggestion is that could you also bring in the time of sleep/awake into consideration. For example sleeping between 1am to 9am isn’t as healthy as 10pm to 6am. If you can bring a metric/ colour code for this, it would be awesome and also encourage people to sleep early. This is the most overlooked aspect in today’s world.",5
"November 24, 2021","Excellent app. Excellent features. I’m using it every day and I love everything about it! I set goals each week and it helps educate me on my sleep patterns. Worth the money. UI and accuracy of sound recordings is great, my only request would be to add “Add a nap” feature to combine naps and night time sleep together for the day. Overall, would buy again. Have recommended to numerous friends and family",5
"October 30, 2021","I bought this app about 4-5 months ago and now I get all the premium features free. One of my most used app for health. It is quite interesting to hear my sleep audios in the morning. One time I was unable to sleep and was listening to my brother chatting away to himself in his sleep. He then suddenly said, “I’m going on a murdering rampage”… yeah, that was fun for me at 3 am in the dark!!! and yes I am definitely sure he was asleep at the time haha... I definitely recommend this app.",5
"December 22, 2021","I have used this app for 4 months or so now. It’s very good at tracking how long you were really asleep, your sleep recordings, and the kinds of sleep you get. When you have odd sleep (wake up right after going to sleep, lie too still before going to sleep, etc), it might not give you perfect numbers. But that’s OK for me; it’s right most of the time and you can exclude an odd night from your history if you want. It’s a few dollars—definitely worth it.",5
"December 6, 2021","This is a wonderful app and gives great feedback on all aspects of sleep as well as many others. It's also remarkably accurate with its""sleep records"" metric. I'll think I got OK sleep but still not feeling great some morning. Look at the ""sleep records"" level and, sure enough, it's lower that day. Dig a little deeper in the metrics and you can find out why. I've used this app just about every day since I downloaded it years ago - it's fantastic. Many other metrics available and the explanation for all of them is readily available and easily understandable. Wonderful app.",5
"November 24, 2021","I have used this app for almost 3 years now and I can say that this is, without a doubt, the best alarm and sleep tracking app that is on the app market today. You can use it for fee as a great alarm. If you decide to get a subscription, like me, you can monitor your sleep patterns, record your snoring/sleep talking, and actually improve your sleep without medication. I have always had a problem with waking up with other alarms. I used to use 3 or 4 alarms to wake up but now I only use one",5
"December 9, 2021","I've used a few sleep tracking apps now and this one is definitely the best designed and most pleasant to use. I'm happy to know what happened when i/m sleeping. I have been tracking sleep for a few weeks I can see my “deep sleeping” or “awake” according the app I now sleep only 6 or 7 hours a night, calibrating does work here. The only feature I feel it's lacking is the ability to use your own music as the sleep aid.",5
"January 14, 2022","Best sleep app I have tried, far better than any other. Very informative results and listen back to any loud snoring",5
"November 30, 2021","This app has helped me navigate a notoriously tricky sleep period! I love having tools to help me get as much sleep as possible, but it also allows me to give myself grace because I can see my sleep debt is still high. I used to feel frustrated that I always felt tired even when I slept well for one night; I now realize it's not that simple! I can also help myself make better use of my waking hours by scheduling my activities based on my high and low energy cycles. I recommend this to anyone!",5
"October 29, 2021","I am grateful for this app and that I downloaded it, because my sleep is now back on regular when it used to be disrupted sleep in different times of going to bed. Without any doubt this app far out shines any other sleep tracking app in the store. I’m waking up refreshed and going to bed at a decent hour. It’s wise to have this app installed to get precise measurements. Thanks for putting time and effort into making this app. I believe that solid sleep in a normal cycle will increase longevity.",5
"November 30, 2021","Simply incredible !!!!! magnificent alarm clock in the morning, before each time I put a ringtone in alarm clock I detested it afterwards it reminded me too much of the moment when I get up, my eyes glued and saying to me ""go another 5 minutes"". And I LOVE it and you can really assess the quality of your sleep. I strongly advise.",5
"November 23, 2021","This is a great and easy to use app. I’ve been using this app for over a year now and it’s a great app especially if you are serious about understanding and improving your sleep habits. I find it to be accurate, informative and easy to understand. Always i am looking for simple apps to use , not as the other complicated. So, use this one and you will not regret",5
"December 4, 2021","The app worked well until a recent update. After the update. My sleep sounds weren't being recorded. Also after the update, my sleep patterns changed but I'm pretty sure the didn't. It showed I had more deep sleep and less light sleep after the update. Knowing how I sleep. I don't believe this to be true.",2
"December 22, 2021","I like to track all my sleep every day and see the time and quality. It’s so insightful to just look at. It gives so much more depth to the information and as I make lifestyle changes I can see the results reflected in the various aspects of my sleep patterns.Yes, this app has been instrumental in me improving my sleeping habits and the knock on from that is the improvement in my health, weight and productivity. So personally, I have to say I love this app.",5
"December 9, 2021","This app is definitely one of the the best sleep apps out there - trust me, I've had several! Even though you have to pay to access better features I'm very happy with what this app has to offer. Relaxing sounds for you to fall asleep with is my favourite feature. You can also get to read graphs about your sleep and listen to recordings of yourself sleeping. I also normally wake up grumpy but ever since I started using this app I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to start the day! I recommend.",5
"November 12, 2021","This app is life-changing. I love this app and paid for it because I’ve always had people tell me that I snore. It helped me realize that I don’t snore and that everyone was lying to me when they said that. To test this, I slept five weeks and recorded every single night. None of them has a recording of me snoring. Also sleep monitor has the edge in feature set and user interface the design of the ring is very easy to understand. I love the single overall sleep score. So thank you Sleep Monitor",5
"November 29, 2021","The app is really good. Accurate results. I especially love the gentle alarm and sometimes when I feel I've not slept as well as I might have the graph reassures me. It helped me understand how I sleep, and how good I sleep. It also puts a smile on my face when I wake up as you don't get the shock of an alarm, it's calm.",5
"December 22, 2021","I have used the app for almost three months and it has not missed a night of sleep. This app makes tracking sleep easy, accurate, and personalized. Sleep is super important for health, efficiency, mood, and happiness. This app can be personalized to my needs in order to monitor my sleep patterns and where needed to improve them. Very simple and pleased with this sleep app.",5
"November 29, 2021",Good app although I did have to pay to fully experience it and if possible and free trial period and just one thing I found a little annoying is when playing back my recordings the volume is so low even though I've turned my phone up as loud as it can go would be good so you can see how amazing the app is but also it would be really good if this data was able to be shared with Samsung health as this is what I use is this something that could be done if so this will definitely change to 5 stars,3
"October 29, 2021","All I can say about this app is that it is easy to use and it works well. I have tried lots of others and this, at least for me, has been by far the best. The information it collects reflects and supplements my real world experience. I like it so much that I have purchased a pro membership that I use for long-time data analysis. Really like seeing how my sleep and bedroom noise differs from night to night…really informative app…Love it!!!! P.s love the sleep aid",5
"November 24, 2021","This is the most fabulous sleep app in the world ever. I have recommended it to ALL my family and friends. I had access to my sleep data. I like it as a sleep aid and alarm clock and my own daily sleep notes. It has been quite fascinating to track my sleep patterns in relationship to daily activities and health trends. The gentle “wake up” feature is great, because I love to hit the snooze button sometimes.",5
"November 23, 2021","It's been working perfectly fine. I don't have any complaints yet. The monitor is very accurate and records what goes on around you while you sleep. I recommend you download this app. The sleeps sounds also aren't noisy but relaxing and calming, within 3 minutes you'll be drifting away.",5
"December 3, 2021","I have a problem with back pain that affects my sleep. I move frequenty, changing my sleeping position. I tried this app and tried to record my sleep on camera. This app in comparison to video camera record only few of my movements. For example, i made 6 movements in an hour with the similar level of noise. App recorded only 2 audio tracks.",3
"December 22, 2021","Having test a few of the top sleep apps this one did exactly what I wanted. You will ether love or hate the interface. As for me, I love how the developer has continued. I have used the app for almost three months and it has not missed a night of sleep. Leveraged my phone and gave me an amazing amount of data. App works amazingly and I love the insights I am getting from my sleep. Strong recommendation for this app",5
"November 12, 2021","This excellent app has made me realise that the length of time you sleep is not necessarily the best metre for waking refreshed but more the combination of low noise level and depth of sleep. Yet on many occasions I wake refreshed, energetic, and able to function, full of joy. On analyzing my sleep in this app I have half closed rings in deep sleep. On the nights the rings are not half-closed I am aware my sleep was insufficient, often due to external factors, which I endeavour to address.",5
"December 21, 2021",Not accurate at all. Also won't let you dive into the data. For example if you want to see how long you were awake for in-between the sleep. It only gives totals. Also I have no idea where sleep records are so I cannot delete them. So my storage if filling up!!,2
"December 26, 2021",This app has helped me keep a good sleeping schedule and it's been helping me with my insomnia!!,5
"December 16, 2021","Love the app though I really need it to be editable. I'm a disabled senior with vision & motor control issues. So have touched the wrong emoji face for sleep quality more than once. Also I need more options for labels. I need to be able to either add my own labels or have a longer list to call attention to life threatening medical issues such as severe sleep apnea, seizure & the like. Thank you.",4
"November 12, 2021",This was my favourite app for 2 years. Very good customer support. Yesterday I updated app but it crashed after opening it and I emailed to support in the first place. They just fixed the issue within several hours so the app works normally again. Very responsive! This app is extremely helpful as I can change various habits and immediately see an improvement. It also helps me sleep with the relaxing music and I have had no problem with it and my whole family downloaded this app! Just download!,5
"November 24, 2021","I have night terrors and got this app to record my sleep screaming and moaning. Unfortunately it does not recognize or record them. For some reason it records lower volume noises (shifting, grinding teeth) but not higher volume ones (talking, yelling). I've had several episodes since downloading the app, but it's missed all of them. Will have to try another app.",2
"October 30, 2021",I love the analysis of my sleep. If you feel it’s not accurate you can adjust your placement and environmental noise level so each morning to reflect more closely the sleep you feel you had. Very quickly it gets to know when your asleep as opposed to just inactive. The audio recording feature is my favourite and I wish all audios will be included in the historical records. I find the sleep results truly reflects when I’ve had an active day. Thanks for helping me stay on track!,5
"November 9, 2021","An app cannot tell when youre in REM, light, or deep sleep. Updating my review bc after several incorrect reports i did some research. Non wearable sleep apps can only tell when youre awake or sleep. If the data is mostly made up this app is only for recording sounds. Awesome app. Not totally accurate on a cpl occasions (mistakenly shows me as awake all night a few days ago). Non paid is fairly limited, i will definitely consider paying for it once i see more consistent accuracy.",2
"December 3, 2021","What a horrible experience! You can only try the app once every hour? That's so dumb. And the costs keep changing. First it was.29.99, then 13.99, then 17.84? What is up with that? There are FAR better apps out there. I am also convinced that nearly all of the 5* reviews are written by your company, family and friends.",1
"November 1, 2021","The ability to disable the alarm once it goes off to wake you up should be silenced from the Android lock screen. Also, the Android smartwatch should pick up detail and relay/communicate things like heart rate and so forth to the app. I'm kind of disappointed in the app as I thought premium features would include things like this. Otherwise I would give the app 5 stars.",3
"December 22, 2021","This is the first thing I do every morning .. check this App. I had sleep issues before & did a sleep study . After seeing results of sleep / snoring etc., I change my nightly eating & behavior patterns before bed. I make sure my phone is charged during the day in order to keep track of my sleep at night. I love the layers of information. I love numbers and data, even though I have nothing wrong health wise. This app has made me much healthier by getting proper sleep.",5
"November 15, 2021","My son responded to my question on a efficient sleep app for Android by providing link to Sleep Monitor. I am posting a review after using this for 3 months.Truly amazing: it 99% correlates with its detection of light sleep, deep sleep etc.If I sleep during day time that’s also getting captured with highest accuracy. Thanks for this amazing app.",5
"November 27, 2021",I paid for an annual subscription to this app. I worked 16 hours a day throughout my life I never knew a snored but now I know I do snore and it’s becoming a bad effect around me whoever sleeps in bed with me. But I will say this… this app has help me make it better with my deep sleep I have ever had in years. It allow users to download and send those clips to their doctors (or anyone they want). Thank you for solving a problem I didn’t think there was a solution for!,5
"November 22, 2021","If you're my type of person, don't download it. There's nothing wrong with the app itself, actually, it works really well. I just feel like I'm being watched, since I do know that my voice is getting recorded. I first tried it with the relaxing sounds but It kept waking up and I couldn't relax. It literally scared me at this point.Edit: tried everything to unlock sounds and watched literally 5 ads and got nothing, just my time wasted I'm stuck with this dumbass ""soothing sea"" song which I hate.",2
"November 15, 2021","Based on this sleep pattern is evaluated and nicely presented. This app works like a wizard in figuring out what time(s) you've been asleep. It's a little tough to work your way around the app (to me) though, I've given it 5 stars.",5
"October 30, 2021",The app really gives you a lot of information about your sleep cycle. It's interesting to see the changes from night to night. I have had sleep issues for most of my life but I have never really been able to see if there's a pattern but now I can in the comfort of my own home and in my own bed. It's really pretty cool! I like it. I purchased the subscription for the year it's only 20 bucks but for that amount of money it gives you a lot of information. I would recommend it!,4
"November 9, 2021","Doesn't show I was awake even when I get out of bed, doesn't show I had dreams /REM, counts awake time as part of sleep. Often shows a largely incomplete track. Really glad I checked it out before I paid. It's barely better than useless.",1
"November 25, 2021","Giving a 1 star review because it doesn't matter how great an app is, upon first download I opened this app for the first time to receive 3 adverts in a row pushing me to buy the premium subscription, all with different offers. Just feels like a malware app at that point. I don't mind apps advertising their premium services, but 3 times before I'd even used the app is extreme. Offer it once and then leave it a couple of uses before offering again.",1
"November 18, 2021","I really had high hopes for this app, then I realized it wasn't accurate because it Said sometimes I was deep asleep When I was Wide awake, and I wasn't dreaming the same time I did. Maybe a bit accurate but No I think maybe you need a watch to see your accurate sleep",2
"November 23, 2021","Haven't tried it out yet but the first time you open it you're met with a 29 dollar yearly pro plan paywall. The sleep tracker seems to be free but other then that your gunna have to fork over some money. Trends, Relaxing sounds gotta pay 29 dollars!",2
"December 9, 2021","I have mild sleep apnea and like the night recordings. I have a fitbit and my night's result was wrong with this app. It gave me incorrect total sleep in excess of 20% and was over 300% wrong on my deep sleep. When I first opened the app, it communicated I needed to decide now if I would buy premium at a discount. I don't appreciate this marketing pressure without providing me with information on what I would receive for free and what exactly I receive when I pay premium. I want a refund!",1
"December 6, 2021",Was already paying the yearly of 13.99 for quite some time and was able to see the trend. I was even telling my friend how good the app is but now. It now prompts me to get the Pro version at 29.99 and locks my data that I had previously.,1
"December 8, 2021","Reading other people's reviews I decided to uninstall. To me, the pop up ads with loud audio is a no no. Especially at 6am in the morning. Also most of the data isn't true to my sleep cycle.",1
"November 10, 2021","Been using this app for a year, really changed my insomnia! These last 3 days wouldn't work so didn't sleep as my routine was disrupted.. I love the timer on sound, if I am woken, I only need press a button and music will play another 5 minutes and so on.... 👍😴",5
"October 29, 2021","Not a premium experience, even after paying. Didn't get the ability to track by custom sleep factors. Also now will only show 3 days worth of data. Please don't spend money on this app!",1
"November 28, 2021",I have sleep apnea. There are some nights that I do not use my Cpap machine and some nights that I do. This app is really useful because it monitors my snoring and breathing while I sleep and I can share the sleep logs with my doctors which helps them treat my apnea better. The small cost for the upgrade from the free version is definitely worth it!,5
"December 2, 2021",Wow !! This app is too intrusive and needy for all the advertising they force on you as well as the manual entering of the data. There isn't any automation in this app at all.,1
"December 16, 2021","Doesn't actually record sleep patterns properly. I'm a chronic, lifelong insomniac and decided to use this during first trial of sleeping pills. It records me falling asleep much earlier than I did & does not record several instances of me waking in the night",3
"November 9, 2021","Excellent app, looks great, and simple to use. Only downside is that I discovered that I snore like a walrus speaking in tongues. 5/5, would recommend.",5
"December 12, 2021","The app records wrong sounds. I mean cheating application. I installed it and started using it to record how my wife talks in her sleep at night. Instead, I found a recording of male snoring in the morning. I don't snore though.",1
"November 20, 2021","Tried it for a week. According to this, I am apparently NEVER in REM stage. Also just completely inaccurate. Took a nap and slept great with phone right next to me to monitor. Report says I was awake the whole time. Useless. Edited to add-- I hung in there for a few more weeks and found it got better at recognizing light sleep and deep sleep. Still incapable of recognizing REM sleep and shows that I'm never in REM. Sent in numerous ""reports."" Maybe they can fix it, but I'm uninstalling.",2
"January 10, 2022",Does this application need internet? Is it possible to put the mobile phone in flight mode during the night and use this application?,5
"December 11, 2021","EDIT: They solved my problem, I can now use the premium version of the app. Thank you! /// I bought the one year subscription and I can't access to it, like I never paid. I sent and email to the customer service and they told me to click on the ""restore"" option, but it keeps saying that it failed and can't restore my subscription. Even though on google app it says that my subscription is active... So I just lost my money.",4
"November 16, 2021","A few times I've woken up in the middle of the night for 8-10mins, and it registered as light sleep. But, like I said, it was only a few times and I've been using it for over a month. By far the best and most detailed I've ever used 💯",4
"November 8, 2021","This was grand to begin with till I seen the price !! RIDICULOUS I CAN GET THIS FREE ELSEWHERE !! UPDATED OK WHERE & HOW WALK ME thru this if you will thanks Update: I don't know how much clearer and plainer I can put it WITH ALL DUR RESPECT I CAN GET THIS ELSEWHERE "" FREE"" MIGHT NOT BE THE EXCACT SAME THING but it works AND ITS FREE !!! 🙂🙂 no need for emails DONE EXPLAINING THIS HIGH COST APP",1
"December 2, 2021","This app is amazing! It's relaxing and comes with its own music. Even without the add-ons you have to buy, it's super useful and extremely accurate. I recommend getting this app.",5
"December 5, 2021",Good apps for sleep record. Seems quite accurate for the free functions for using sound to analysis sleep quality. Don't know if the trend analysis Pro version (paid) is as good.,4
"October 28, 2021","I was def not asleep at such times. And it never detects REM sleep even if I prob was in one (I dream??) But if it cant detect when im sleeping, the app is useless in my case",2
"December 7, 2021",I paid for premium but haven't received the upgrade. I asked Google for a refund and they said I didn't qualify. Not happy. Out $30 for nothing unless developers decide to to actually upgrade my app,3
"November 20, 2021",I rate it 4 star's due to letting me be able to record for free wish it had more free features but glad to be able to record this is great if you have night terror's talk in ur sleep or have sleep paralysis or other sleep disorders,4
"December 30, 2021",Omgg i have never felt this relaxed in a whole year its so relaxing a d soothing it made me go to sleep in seconds!!,5
"December 14, 2021",The app seems good for from what I can tell. Unfortunately it doesn't work perfectly because as soon as my brother walks on he turns it off and moves it away but that's not your fault so when we move out I will make another review!,4
"January 18, 2022",Opened the app was immediately asked to pay a subscription then given ads when I wanted to see how the app works before paying money,1
"January 15, 2022",my alarm didn't go off because of this app. I didn't wake up and missed my appointment.,1
"November 26, 2021","Selecting ""start"" should make it start working, right? Apparently not. I saw it start but 4 hours later. . . No data. Must we pay for everything?",1
"January 9, 2022",Good Apps... hopefully can improved to be more precise in the future,5
"January 1, 2022",This app help so much i rec8mend it to others. It is simpe and it gives good results.best app out there for sleep,5
"November 10, 2021","I tried this last night for FIRST time. Besides being bombarded by constant full page ads, your info is totally false. I am injured and in a lot of pain at night; I barely slept last night. Yet your ""analysis"" says I had a great night with reports of deep sleep most of the night. Deinstalling.",1
"October 27, 2021",All my sleep recordings sound the same. I've never heard anyone snore the exact same every night...losing faith in this app real quick!,2
"December 14, 2021","Using the free version one week later I still snore alot, the recordings are so funny 🤣 I play the sleep sounds too they definitely help send me off to snoring land 😴 Thanks for a great app 👍",5
"December 11, 2021","I don't know how this app has 4.8 stars, as soon as I started it it showed me like 4 ads! Unstalling. Do not download this app!",1
"November 19, 2021","I love this app so much. I'm so glad I saw a video about this app from Tiktok. I can track the amount of my sleep, the noise I make, etc. Thank you so much for making such great app!",5
"January 10, 2022",Informational and helpful to focus on improving sleep.,5
"December 1, 2021","Tried for one night & completely inaccurate, can't even get a refund from Google because it says there's no purchases but my bank statement says otherwise, and I only have one google account 😡",1
"November 17, 2021",I'm a sleepwalker and dont sleep well but this app has been awesome for tracking my sleep and recording the strange things I talk about while sleeping. 100% worth the money,5
"December 22, 2021","Waking up rested, hearing snoring, being aware of the ambient noise level, this app is great.",5
"November 1, 2021",I bought it and then switched phones now I gotta pay again because it won't recognize my subscription. Absolute garbage.,1
"December 24, 2021",Way too many annoying ads and won't pay the ridiculous asking price for premium.,3
"December 15, 2021",I accidently clicked on subscribe button and cancelled it in less than a minute but still they charged me for nothing please dont charge it was a mistake.,1
"December 15, 2021",Easy to use. Free version tracks 7 nights . Audio playback could be louder but maybe my system.,5
"November 22, 2021",Super helpful and interesting. I hadn't realized before that I just don't get REM sleep. It's super helpful to know.,5
"January 11, 2022",Its good tho sometimes ot wont register the time and the alarm wont go off,3
"November 2, 2021",Ya'll.... Super impressed with the design of this app. Originally found this on tiktok but I think it'll really help me sleep. Only first night in but I discovered lots of cool things already. Will update this review <3,5
"November 6, 2021",This app was great for the first few days but after it kept losing my data and using my memory up. Fix this.,2
"January 7, 2022",Easy to use and good reporting,5
"December 11, 2021",Love it. Super interesting to see and hear about your sleep cycles amd stuff. I'd love to get some more information on what the statistics mean for my health.,5
"November 15, 2021",I love this app I struggle to sleep so I like to measure my average sleep for my doctor as I attempt to figure out the source of my insomnia.,5
"January 17, 2022",I'm having trouble believing that I'm getting little to no REM sleep. Will update in a few more weeks.,4
"November 21, 2021",Go to asmr sounds listen to crinkling sounds. Why does the lady say her teeth are sensitive so she uses crest whitening strip?? This is sleep sounds who the f falls alseep to people crinkling paper and saying they have to use crest whiting strip? This app is ghetto as f. Who falls asleep to people making popping sounds with their mouth? How about stopping on leaves? how about game controller sounds or writing on paper? If ted bundy needed ambient noises to fall asleep this is his app Delete asap,1
"December 6, 2021","Hey, I purchased the pro version yearly days ago and now is asking me to purchase again and failed restore ..... what the # is happening",3
"December 6, 2021",I quite like the app but after paying the annual subscription I still get heaps of annoying ads.,2
"November 1, 2021",Excellent app. Recordings helped discover what was disturbing my sleep.,5
"December 14, 2021","I kept hearing a voice that was not my own. Impossible since I sleep alone, deleted it. I'm assuming the app inserts voices or something",3
"October 26, 2021","OMG, this what I was looking for 😍😍 it helped me alooot and easy to use, really thank you. I recommend 👌 The best sleep monitor 😴 ❤👍",5
"December 9, 2021",Thought it was good and then it didn't record my second night at all and I can't figure out why or what went wrong. Disappointed.,2
"December 22, 2021","Ads after every function, despite saying will be unlocked forever.",1
"October 29, 2021","Great app, though I wish they had the option to sync with Google fit and apps like that",5
"November 16, 2021",All my sleep recordings u don't hear anything 😔 the sleep sounds are nice but don't last long enough,3
"December 13, 2021",One thing why extra sounds have been added in the recording? Fake app. Really shameful.,1
"November 22, 2021","Only wish I could get details on times of sleep changes and have key words like ""bathroom"" so ""awake""",4
"November 27, 2021",This app is very good it helps me know how many hours I sleep and if I make a sound 💤💤❤️,4
"November 16, 2021",Very user friendly and quite interesting to keep record of sleeping patterns,5
"January 14, 2022","This app is in decent detail about sleep, I like it",4
"November 6, 2021",It's fun and informative. It's always interesting to see what happens throughout the night.,4
"January 4, 2022",Can you create an option to auto-start sleep check ? I keep missing turning it on.,4
"December 14, 2021",Alarm doesn't work. Ads too bright at night.,1
"January 12, 2022","Ive been using for 2 years now, I get to hear my sleep talking now",5

"November 17, 2021","Keeps crashing after they ""fixed crashing issues""",2
"November 27, 2021","I have regular, very intense nightmares. Almost nightly. I’ve been told I talk in my sleep and I have woken up crying multiple times. after my daughter came into my room and heard me talking in my sleep, she told me I said “don’t hit her, she’s a 75 year old lady!” I knew then that I had to hear what I was saying for myself. I found this app and I was sold. I use it every night and every morning I hear myself say something. I love that I can save clips, and it is fascinating knowing what I say.",5
"November 5, 2021","I was told I snored I just didn't know how loud I was how much I snored, I also love that it tells me when I'm in a deep sleep, I light sleep, a REM sleep, what time I fell asleep, how long I slept,.... 🤍🖤🤎💜💙💚💛🧡❤️",5
"November 29, 2021",Didn't realize how much snoring I was doing until I got this app. Very important information!,5
"October 31, 2021",This app helps me learn what my sleep patterns are and also helps me stay asleep 5/5,5
"December 3, 2021",Very clear and easy to read with great sound,5
"December 20, 2021","Not reliable, starts sometimes and sometimes not, also horrible ux",1
"January 12, 2022",This app really helped me to track my sleep.,5
"January 17, 2022",Its better to purchase smart watch. This app is not at all accurate.,1
"November 6, 2021",The app is great! I love it because it puts nice sounds,5
"November 14, 2021",It did pretty good at tracking my sleep.,5
"December 31, 2021",I really like this app. it's easy.,5
"October 27, 2021",I don't know whether this application shows correct report or not but if it does then It is a superb application. I am really grateful for the creator of this application because this application made me keep track on my sleep and how much I sleep in a day. I love the way it shows in a statistical data of my sleep. No more suggestions for improvement because all its features are well designed. But I hope this shows actual data and analysis.,5
"December 12, 2021","App instantly shoves subscriptions and ads in your face, not gonna bother giving it a try.",1
"January 3, 2022",Super helpful and easy to use.,5
"September 28, 2021","I’ve had this app since its first iteration and while I apprciated it back then, I didn’t like having to put my phone in bed with me. So i uninstalled it. Now I know you can put the phone on the bedside table or the floor, but I listen to meditation sounds when I sleep and I’m not sure how it would track my voice? I reinstalled this app for all the great features it offers.",5
"September 27, 2021","I’ve been using this app for over a year and it’s fared me mostly fine. I can see lots of sleep information at night which I cannot get without this app. A niggle I have with it is the apps inability to determine when I actually fall asleep. If you have trouble sleeping and don’t get off for a long time, the app seems to decide that you fell asleep within a few minutes. It would be helpful if they added an ‘actual asleep’ feature so you could manually change the time. So overall, yeah, it’s worth it!",5
"October 31, 2021","It really shows exactly like how you sleep, you are downloading just perfect app to track your sleep cycle stop wasting your time in thinking and searching this is perfect app for you i am using this for over a year now so yeah! Go for it;)",5
"September 17, 2021","I see my previous review is gone. App keeps turning itself off in the middle.of the night. Not even open at all. Then the kicker. This morning, I went to check because it was actually still on and it said ""abnormal sleep pattern detected. No record saved"". Well hell's bells, isn't that the whole point of the app? To see why you didnt get proper sleep? I can just see sleep studies tell their clients ""well, your sleep pattern was abnormal so we didn't keep a record to find out why"" What a crock",1
"September 28, 2021","This app helps me know my average sleep per day, which is very good. So now that I am on vacation, time to give this app a taste of 8hrs of sleep. Shows interesting graphs on sleep phases and sleep efficiency. However, I seem to still feel groggy after waking up even if it wakes me up at the time my sleep is the lightest. Anyways it might be a personal thing.",5
"September 27, 2021",For some reason my other alarms don't wake me up. I started using this to help me sleep better and wake up on time for school. The sounds are not annoying at all and it even puts me in a good mood. It's like a good morning kiss from your phone. Highly recommended app for those who want to be productive but cant because they cant manage their sleep. Please add widget support so we can easily track our sleep,5
"October 12, 2021","I’m using Sleep Monitor, and prefer to keep with it ,it’s good, affordable with just one payment and accurate. specially when I Compare it with Sleep Cycle (endless payments In -app Purchases !) I often fall asleep on the couch and wake up to move to the bed after 1 or 2 sleep cycles. While I never imagined it would be scientifically accurate, I find the more deep sleep it reports, the better I actually slept. Also the readiness score has been pretty accurate for me.",5
"October 7, 2021","So far the app is great! It does not drain my phone battery so much. About 30% for a whole night's tracking. I loved everything about it, but I wish it can include the sleep cycle alarm, i.e. wake you up by calculating your sleep cycle (~90 mins), and also; how many hours to alarm time; display when we set the alarm clock would be great too! This will allow us to know how much time we can sleep before sleeping. Question: Keep charging won’t affect battery?",5
"September 8, 2021","App is great, beautiful UI and I think the tracker works well, although I can only see that I only get light sleep every night, never deep or rem. It's probably true, since I don't usually sleep for many hours (trying to change that). Good app, I'd recommend. Suggestion: why not including an sleep cycle calculator inside the app? That would be great.",5
"August 23, 2021","Unfortunately, they have changed the way you stop the monitor from a ""press and hold"" to a ""slide up"" and my phone will not do it. There's no information on *what* to slide. With an Android phone, if you ""slide up"" as instructed, the tab collapses but the sleep monitor program does not stop. I will now lose all my data as I can't stop the monitor I have been asleep for 32 hours ....",2
"September 28, 2021","As an insomniac I installed this app to try and help with my sleep patterns and falling asleep. Upgraded to premium straight away as I found the extra features are really worth it. I use a smart watch and have compaired the movement data between the watch device and this app, they both correlate extremely well, which gives me confidence in how it processes information. I use the app in a room with a relatively noisy (window type) conditioner running all night, but the app doesn’t seem to have any problem with it, likewise when I’ve just used an oscillating fan. The graphs it gives are all useful and well displayed. So that’s all good.",5
"October 7, 2021","This app is really cool, theres only one problem i have tho. Dont make a lot of noise when i sleep but it helps track how much sleep i actually get and also takes some cool recordings. Im in the army and sleep isnt always garanteed but what is, is getting really cool recording of aircrafts, pt formation runs/workout noises and more. Love it and will continue to use it. Now the problem, how in the world does it calculate rem sleep? By the chart i dont ever go to rem sleep but once. Not sure how.",5
"October 12, 2021","I stumbled upon your app by accident, and I'm delighted I did. As with a reference sleep tracker, end user would have some idea how much time was spent on sleep states other than awake. My thoughts were that some apps were too generous with deep sleep and no so good when detecting awake stages. In general, i think this app is better for tracking sleep. Also reporting REM sleep in some of the apps is a bit misleading. I'm curious what your app's results will be. Cheers!",5
"October 8, 2021","I love it!!! Living with an autoimmune disease sleep patterns have been an issue. However, using the different sleep features has vastly improved my sleep with one slight issue, I still haven't heard if I snore during deep sleep. Overall I'm not quite the master of sleep but it's helping me get there.",5
"September 24, 2021",So far appears to do what it's supposed to do quite nicely! Been using this for about a week now and the information is acurate! It also wakes you up well instead of waking up when you're in a deep sleep it wakes uou in a light sleep. I love that it works so well with my phone. Gentle alarm is perfect. I look forward to collecting about a month's worth of sleep data.,5
"August 26, 2021","This a pretty good app. I wasn't looking to detect snoring, but this is all that's out there. It's easy to use &the smart alarm is nice. It breaks down wake/light or deep sleep/rem, which is informative. The downside is that you have to listen to every audio to see what the sounds actually were-snoring, breathing pause, the neighbors dogs, etc. Also, it does not total the sleep time, it totals the time from turning it on to turning it off. ""Duration"" could be 8 hrs, but only 7 hrs of sleep.",4
"October 5, 2021","Deceptive. Was hoping to monitor my sleep and the app seemed to be doing a good job monitoring sleep cycles with lots of attractive graphs but didn't have a base to compare against to see if it was accurately measuring my sleep. Then I woke up in the middle of the night once, and even talked to my spouse, and the app was none the wiser and thought it was REM sleep. All decoration. No substance.",1
"September 24, 2021",Another creative use of the technology. Interesting to see ur sleeping patterns.I have been using this app every night since I download it. I always feel better when the alarm wakes me up in morning. I do not have to hit the snooze at all I feel great and ready for my day each morning. Nothing had ever helped me wake up like this app. And I love to see my patterns during the night too. It's pretty cool to see the sleep patterns! Would be nice to see the graph bigger if you rotated it sideways.,5
"September 23, 2021",Definitely a cool app. Works as advertized. I use this app every night. Very accurate stats. Its my favorite clock app. They continue to improve and update features. It helps me chart my sleep patterns and I can clearly see how well I slept the night before. A great app!! I never reviewed for any apps and because this app works I took my effort to give five stars.,5
"October 19, 2021","I have been using Sleep Monitor for more than 1 year now, and believe it’s one of the better health tools out there. I especially love that it contains so much in-depth information, and easily accessible graphic historical sleep values, which allows someone who is extremely health conscious to dig deeper into the details. Perhaps some users want an app to summarize everything for them. I want to see all of the readings used to calculate that average. I want the details, and this app make them available. Sleep Monitor's reports are an essential part of my day.",5
"September 23, 2021","Love this app. It really works and the alarm sounds are beautiful.I use it every night! The update was awesome! Thank you!!! I don't know if it really works at first, but so far so good. It does wake me up gently in the morning. I find the graph interesting to review in the morning. I think it does register pretty well since seems like when I feel like I've gotten a good night sleep that's when the graph shows I've had a lot of deep sleep cycles.",5
"September 21, 2021","I got this to see if I snore a lot. The microphone is way too sensitive. Whenever my AC turns on it records that as an event, so this has been completely useless since I get dozens of ""events"" a night. It also says there's too much ambient noise in a completely silent room.",1
"October 12, 2021",I've been using Sleep Monitor tracker for just a week. I find it captures the times I wake up during the night well - but that may be because I'm also getting out of bed to head to the bathroom. I do find that it gives me credit for light sleep when I know I'm awake but resting in a still state (when I'm first in bed). I think DEEP SLEEP tracking is over-rated. Can you explain that? I have no clue what this means or what to do to improve this. Any thoughts there?,5
"September 27, 2021","I work nights and sleep during the day. I downloaded your app to document the interruptions in my sleep caused by my family members. Your app records the various times I'm woken up for whatever reasons by my family. During these interruptions, your app shows that I am in deep sleep or even in REM sleep. It's shown the same thing when I've gone to use the restroom. How can I be asleep when I'm actually awake? What is going on?",1
"August 8, 2021","I've been using this app for two weeks now. The graphs/statistics are fun, and simply add to what is a great core of an app. With the new update, I got gentle alarm tones which always seem to go off just at the perfect time and is very straightforward to get up and running with. Highly recomend",5
"September 28, 2021",Informative app. Breakthrough app is breakthrough. Superb sleep analytics. Very informative; reliable alarm system. Tracks movements somewhat correctly during stay in bed. I find this app helpful! I feel more relaxed when sleeping and upon waking up. More sleep aids please? :) or is it possible to customize a playlist as a sleep aid?,5
"September 28, 2021","Despite using just the free features, it gets its job done. You don’t have to pay or anything, all you have to do is start the tracking and you are set, and the sleep tracking is fantastic because it accurately tracks the length of sleep well. As for the sleep aid side, I personally wish Sleep Monitor will offer more music just like headspace offers where this is concerned.",5
"September 18, 2021","No idea if this app is good or not, I uninstalled and used a competitor because of the predatory ""new user offer"" for premium with a countdown that was presented to me upon opening the app. I don't mind a quick shill for a premium version, but ""continue"" or ""skip"" should take you on to the free app, not a near-hidden x, and having a timer there and a ""only 22 left"" is just, as I said before, predatory.",1
"October 5, 2021",Of cause 5 stars from me.This application provides plenty of detail about your sleep using phone's microphone as a sleep tracker. Don’t worry it also has a mode where it can use the Android on your bed for tracking your sleep.The stats can reveal why you feel so sluggish this morning. Maybe you didn’t get enough deep sleep. Highly recommend this app for keeping fit. After a good workout you need to have a good rest. This app will tell you if you rested well.,5
"August 24, 2021","To my surprise, I actually like using this app, but recently the option to stop recoding has changed from press and hold for few seconds, to swipe up, it's very annoying. You have to swipe up few times before it registers, swiping up few times just when you have woken up is not relaxing at all. Press and hold is simple and gets the job done without the drama.",3
"September 25, 2021",I have a feeling that this app put in a prerecorded voice recording. I checked my voice recordings in the morning to find the first one with very well put together gibberish but it sounded nothing like my voice and it was a little scary. I think the app put it there to scare people. Can I get confirmation?,2
"October 9, 2021","Decided to get this app so see how much I snore since my wife has to sleep with earplugs. Recorded my first night so that was good, but used it for more than a week now and every morning says ""no noise detected"" even tho she woke me up several times every night. Hope this will get sorted soon or I'll check for a better app. Rest seems good but dont know how accurate it is since im sleeping when it records.",2
"September 10, 2021","It's ok but needs improvement! It's not letting me put notes in after I wake up despite the fact that it has a place for additional notes and it should have a label titled ""Grinding"" listed with the other possible noise labels, like ""Snoring"" for instance, because a lot of people grind their teeth. And if your dog sleeps with you then it might record HIS sleeping instead of yours. EXAMPLE: One night I had insomnia and didn't sleep a wink, yet the app. said I got lots of deep sleep.",3
"October 10, 2021","Finding it helpful. I am using it for sleep recordings as i talk/yell in my sleep and I'm extremely curious to catch a recording.(the best one so far that I've been told about is just me yelling ""tarantula!"") Apparently my subconscious is shy since i got the app but wow... i sure do snore 😅 Not sure how the sleep pattern stuff is determined but I'm not using the app for that purpose as of yet. It works well to record even over my fans and ac unit. May pay for the upgrade.",5
"September 4, 2021","The app is easy to use, the only problems I've encountered are that sometimes it won't record any noises yet I know that I have been up in the night (maybe a problem with my phone though) and this was one of the reasons that I paid for the app. I like how it shows the sleep stages and I think its more accurate than my garmin ⌚. The music is relaxing too and helps me get to sleep soooo easy!",4
"October 12, 2021","It's okay, it hasn't recorded alot of things that it should've picked up. For example my cats started fighting in the middle of the night which woke me up and I had to break it up. The app never recorded any of it. Then there were several 30 second recordings of nothing.",3
"September 28, 2021","I work during the night shift so it's quite a pain for me to get up in the morning. I'm always guilty of waking up, shutting my alarm clock (which blasts so hard that I wake up with a heart attack), and then going back to sleep. was at first skeptical about this app but I just tried it and for some reason when it finally went off, it felt like i was ready to get out of bed. I calmly got the phone, shut it off without the rush, and got off the bed to prepare for work. One of the few times that I didn't go back to sleep again. For a buck, this is a no brainer. Easiest wake up I had for a long time. Feels like a wake up from a long rest even though practically I still lack sleep. Great app.",5
"October 12, 2021",This is a very good APP with a lot of features about understanding my sleep. Deep sleep is so important in maintaining BDNF and HGH in the aging population. I am 65 year old and although I have a good understanding on modern electronic devices I find it difficult to understand and decide on which is a good sleep app. I want to track my sleep and try to make changes in my life to improve my sleep. Not sure I need the amount of information being provided in the Sleep Monitor app. Help Please.,5
"October 4, 2021",I like this app a lot as it is really good analse tool for the sleep and also quite exact. It has loads of features and customization options. Makes great use of the ANDROID. I still can't get over how I am less stressed when being wake up with this apps alarm. The soothing music to and the timing ( alarm goes off when I am in shallow sleep) may have to do with that.,5
"October 16, 2021",Very fun & interesting app. I have had insomnia since 1979. App shows I am sleeping more than I thought. It has improved my attitude & sleep confidence. I think the deep & rem are pretty accurate. The light sleep not so accurate. I lay still on my back with my headset and do a relaxed stomach breathing. The app shows light sleep. All in all it is fun and has helped my sleep. I simultaneously use another app for music/meditation. My inexpensive phone has never disconnected the sleep app.,5
"August 27, 2021","I saw this sleep app featured on a YouTube video on fixing her sleep schedule, so I downloaded it thinking “Oh maybe it will work for me too” I didn’t really have high hopes but it turns out this app is amazing! I really recommend! This has fixed my sleep schedule so much even though I'm sleepzy when I’m writing this But I have a sleep reminder scheduled to go to bed at 2:11am! This app is my life saver! Not to mention there are so many other features like sleep time analysis and sleep music.",5
"September 28, 2021","Im not sure how it works or is it really working bur I think it helps a little bit to monitor how you were sleeping the last night. I tried putting it in a drawer near my bed but not beside my bed and I still get those graphs with ups and down, so I doubt it, but I try again puting it outside my room and I see a straight line so I think it might really is working. Anyway, its good.",5
"October 4, 2021","No automatic tracking. Gotta press start every night. - and it instantly tries to get you to pay for a very expensive Pro version. And it just says continue (to payment), there's no skip button. And of course they use a ""deal"" to make it seem like you're getting a special price.",1
"October 14, 2021","For the first night it worked great, but every night since I've only gotten 15 minutes or so of data until it goes silent. I've turned off optimise battery usage for the app and it still does this. Until I can find a solution this app is unusable!",2
"January 10, 2022","Bombarded with Ads before I setup, deleted",1
"August 29, 2021","Been using this on and off for a while. Works just like intended. I understand some peoples desire for louder sounds, but I have never had a problem with the current sounds. They are so nice to wake up to and it is hard to se most people having an issue since the alarm is so near your head.",5
"October 2, 2021","I like the app, been using for about 3 weeks now. I really like the smart alarm feature, it works wonders! Only problem is that recently the alarm stopped ringing. I've checked the settings but everything seems normal.. Is there a reason it doesn't work anymore? It worked fine before",4
"October 5, 2021","I had subscribed to premium for 12 months. Can I share this subscription with family members under my iCloud family? I love this app as it is not annoying and wake you up gently, you’ll feel fresh n happy too. BUT, this app tracks your sleep and thus your phone is running for 8hrs straight and it requires high battery percentage. What I am worried for is that these two terms would damage your phone overtime... if only it is possible to switch off the recording and add another option of only alarm without tracking, that would be great. If not, well it is still a great app.",5
"August 23, 2021",Helps brilliantly to understand your sleep patterns ability to get to sleep and what happens whilst asleep itself. Although some of the interaction and delivery along with very littleeditable data is somewhat frustrating. Equally whilst their is a selection of sounds to help these are limited and confusing to use. Overall it is great to understand your sleep but lacks finesse in the other areas.,4
"August 27, 2021",I have struggles getting up in the mornings my entire life. This app has changed the way I sleep. It just knows the best possible time to get me up. I can\'t wait for some more improvements! Love this app!!! So much fun looking at my sleep graph in the morning. Wish I could do more with the analytics though. Export to excel?,5
"September 27, 2021","I noticed that the sleep hours are accurate, I slept for 8hours and 30minutes and it shows that. After I turned this ON, I closed my eyes immediately and fell asleep quickly, and it shows me that i slept for 8 hours. Glad to see that. Thank you for helping out during these hard times. We truly appreciate this app! Stay safe devs!",5
"August 11, 2021",Tried using this app for several nights in a row but it recorded a bunch of my fan/air conditioner instead of recording me. I don't always talk in my sleep but there were a few nights when my husband said I talked but the app caught nothing. I don't want to spend my mornings listening to a bunch of recordings of my fan or air conditioner.,1
"August 27, 2021",Brilliant idea.This works surprisingly well and it is interesting to track your sleep patterns.I have struggles getting up in the mornings my entire life. This app has changed the way I sleep. It just knows the best possible time to get me up. I can't wait for some more improvements!,5
"August 10, 2021","Try again later.... Try what again later? Still trying to get it started. I guess unless I pay, I'll be trying until I'm blue in the face :( No intentions of paying for something that doesn't work in the first place. Had high expectations with wonderful reviews...but for me it was a big flop",1
"October 1, 2021","I wish there was an option to try it for a week or two for free before committing to get it for a year, if I could try it out first, I am sure I would be willing to pay to keep it. There's too many apps just like this and it's difficult to tell which one is right for me when I can't even see what it does fully. Please consider doing a 2 week free trial before you have to pay for a full year. Thank you so much.",4
"August 24, 2021","The app was great for the first few days that I used it, then it updated and can't detect when I'm sleeping. It said that I was awake all night yet recorded me snoring in a deep sleep. So I decided to try it during my nap and it did the same thing. How do I fix this?",3
"September 10, 2021",The only thing i dislike is that i have to remember to turn off the repeat alarm. So i set an alarm on friday morning. But only THIS friday morning. I forget to uncheck the box. Next Friday morning the alarm goes off. Got so angry I wanted to give it 1 star... :)),5
"August 14, 2021","All the blatant marketing trickery used 2 seconds after installing. My preference is to try the app as a full featured trial before parting with money. And a subscription model, more unnecessary gouging. And not exactly cheap. So...",1
"September 8, 2021","This has a fundamental flaw. Under 'time spent asleep' it adds up the time you spent in light sleep, deep sleep, and 'awake'. How can you be asleep if you're awake? How does being awake count towards your sleep goal? Makes me question a lot about its calculations. Also can't edit sleep notes or records once they're saved. It looks nice, but not convinced on accuracy.",1
"November 15, 2021",I don't know how this app works but if what it displays is true then I'm impressed.,5
"October 28, 2021","Very good app, I didn't know that I was a snorer until I got this app and it is perfect for dream journaling.",5
"October 5, 2021","I never found such amazing apps like this, Sleep Monitor not just waking me sleep, but it also wakes me up from swing-moods caused by irregular sleep paterns. I owe you so much. Thanks. Just thanks so much! To the developer: I will give you another five stars if you add another important improvement to your genius creation.""",5
"September 26, 2021","Generally happy with app, but want to be able to go back and add additional notes or modify scores after the initial review of the previous night's sleep. Please make editing of previous records possible!!",4
"September 27, 2021",Completely false advertising. About app says FOR FREE but when in app all it does is track sleep hours and play sounds. Charges for everything else that they list is free. If I could give negative stars I would. 1 star rating is giving to much credit,1
"September 19, 2021","Currently can't add notes despite it being a major feature. The sleep tracking doesn't always catch REM sleep unless on top of the phone. Also, can't figure out how to use the labels. Otherwise great app for sleep tracking and improving sleep quality.",3
"October 19, 2021","Never learned so much while asleep. The dr has told me that my seizures may be increasing due to not enough sleep so I decided to download this app. I thought I was getting plenty of sleep but my sleep quality is lacking and I wouldn’t have known without this app! There are some things I definitely need to work on! First thing in the morning I check to see all the information provided, which is spectacular in-depth analysis. A serious app for serious problems. Two thumbs up.",5
"September 24, 2021","Worked great at first, now the alarm goes off at the wrong time. I set it at 5am this morning but it instead went off at 7am. Has been doing so all week. Unreliable.",1
"October 10, 2021","Need to be improved 1- Not showing how many hours I am going to sleep (for alarm) 2- challenge wake up 3- some of the sounds need to be extended to more than one minutes, because you notice the cut in the sound every 10 seconds",3
"October 23, 2021","I love the design and how easy it is to use, but the only thing I could criticise is that the ""pro"" is almost shoved in your face saying ""go pro"" I would like a varying of different ""pros"" because not evey one can afford that much every month",4
"October 20, 2021","5 stars, but I think it's missing a cool feature. You should be able to upload custom alarms, through spotify or something like that. Overall good app.",5
"August 22, 2021",Don't like the new slide to stop features. Makes it hard to turn off in the morning. The hold for 3 seconds was alot easier. Other than that the rest of the app works perfectly nice to monitor how deep or light I sleep.,3
"December 5, 2021",Very easy to use and works great!,5
"October 15, 2021","Disliked that it immediately prompted me to buy the full version when I just wanted to see how it works, tried to play a sound and it bugged out. From previous reviews I thought this would be good.",2
"October 18, 2021","Does what I want it to do, recorded my snoring. Did not record sleep talking so obviously I was quiet last night. It's easy to use, just ""set it and forget it"". Update: still hasn't recorded any sleep talking. Hubby says I talk so softly he can't understand what I'm saying. Maybe it's too soft to pick up. Question: the longest recordings are 1 minute each. Is that by design?",5
"October 16, 2021",This app helped me with me having sleep paralysis and this app helps me know when things happen it also help me with my states on sleeping this app is amazing and I definitely would recommend using it it has a free part so you don't have to pay aswell,5
"October 8, 2021","CAREFUL: I started this app, put the phone next to my bed while it was attached to a charger, and when I woke up in the morning my phone was completely black. It never turned on again and it's totally bricked. I had to get a new phone.",1
"October 29, 2021","I couldn't even open the thing with out them trying to Make me buy it, then you get adds out the.....",2
"November 16, 2021",Love this app! Its really been s great help!,5
"October 26, 2021",It is a nice app but I think you should do the things to be paid like I have to use some features but they are paid and I don't like to just waste money on these types of things.,4
"August 30, 2021",Hey this app was great and working very well recording my sleep talking and when I tried it again theirs been no sound detected I keep trying but it just says the same thing. Is there anything that can be making this happen?,3
"November 1, 2021",Sometimes the alarm just does not work,1
"September 3, 2021","In depth analysis of sleep patterns and good east to use layout really really good, until 1 night it said the app is 'intermittent' and there's a blank 4 and and half hours, like what's with that?",4
"August 19, 2021","shows correct data.. Good app for sleep tracking. Light sleep, deep sleep, dream, even snsoring sounds are recorded nd data appears relevant.. This app is good.. Keep it",4
"September 6, 2021",I love my sleep Monitor. It feels like it watches over me keeping me safe. Love the soothing music and I fall off to sleep soo easily.i wouldn't go to bed without it. Thank you for this amazing piece of stuff. Clever people!,5
"September 7, 2021",It's pretty easy to use and is a very good app but when alarm goes of the music wakes me up but when I try to stop the music it doesn't stops I have the switch off the phone and start again to stop the music other it's very good ❤️😘❤️,4
"August 25, 2021",Kind of sucks that you have to pay for premium but the free stuff is also really good I love the white noise you can play and it helps me keep track of my sleep 😊😁,4
"October 29, 2021",No way to show if there is sleep apnea No way to export data for my doctor Can't see breathing tracking,1

"November 19, 2021",It's the best it's unique and it works for me! Give it a try🙂😊 it's pretty cool,5
"October 14, 2021","Great app although it's stopped telling me how long it takes for me to fall asleep the moon reason I needed the app, can't find the settings for this any where.",5
"August 21, 2021",Does nothing unless you pay. It is a clock app with ads for a sleep analysis app. Every button to display your sleep data only brings up a purchase screen.,1
"October 2, 2021","Not many ads at all! Works great, even with my fan or air conditioner on. Very reliable and easy to use.",5
"December 16, 2021",It's a really nice app but I wish it was more customizable,4
"September 28, 2021","I'm just about to pay for a full year. I'm very pleased with his app. It confirms that I don't have sleep apnea, and I love how it knows you're in rem sleep. Easy to use.",5
"September 22, 2021",Not sure stats are right. Fails to record toilet trips and drinks. Doesn't let you add them manually. Won't be renewing subscription.,3
"January 5, 2022",This has been a grwat help monitoring sleep patterns due to shift work.,5
"October 9, 2021",Not bad. Gives a bit too much deep sleep but graphs are clear and not too far off most of the time. Reply: to get 5 start improve on recording rem sleep. I wrote already about it see email.,4
"August 13, 2021",I had a good sleep but I can’t sound weird but the app is pretty much good. Customers will buy that get the app would be pretty neat if you did that but I’m not some person trying to say don’t want to be I just wanna let you know that is OK the app is pretty well but you should keep going on and hope you guys have a few have a great day,5
"August 21, 2021","There's only one option for alarm sound the rest don't work, you click to download and nothing happens the icon just goes away, needs fixing.",1
"September 27, 2021",Sleep analysis seems very cool but I'm very new. I can't find the voice recordings to save my life or I'd rate higher. Looked in storage too like FAQ pg said. Please help?,3
"September 12, 2021",Loved the app untill it stopped working about a week ago. Missed a very important meeting due to it not going off.,3
"October 9, 2021",The only reason why im giving 4 stars so far is because there is a lot a lot features that are locked for a permium use i would like to have a little bit more features,4
"August 17, 2021",I have to sleep with a fan on and this app listened to it all night. It doesn't work if you have any background noise at all.,1
"December 14, 2021",all I've to say is that this app is the best and most accurate one!,5
"August 25, 2021","great app to monitor sleep cycle, and the alarm turns off easier now. Though its kinda expensive...",4
"December 1, 2021",I have paid for a year subscripstion and I can't even get the sleep reports. Please solve this problem.,1
"August 17, 2021",I'm not understanding why it records and then sometimes doesn't ?? Overall it's a good app but also needs to be UK appropriate,5
"August 31, 2021",The free version is fine but I wish there were more free sounds available. Some of us are on a budget and can't afford to spend money on things like this.,4
"October 9, 2021",I love it. The sound of spring chirping birds every day wakes me with a smile. Great app. Thank you.,5
"September 11, 2021","Great app, helps to know my sleep patterns and any discomfort I may experience while asleep. Thanks",5
"August 18, 2021",This app really helps because I im a sleep yalker and I talker and say weird things in my sleep and I Moan and groan in my sleep,5
"December 22, 2021","If you're going to charge for everything, don't try to say it's free",1
"September 17, 2021",Hi it works fine. It would be so nice to tap on the bars and see the exact time of the tapped point in the whole map. Plz add it,4
"August 19, 2021",LOVE THIS APP. I use it every night. But the only thing it usually tracks is me turning in my sleep lol,5
"September 8, 2021","I don't like the fee, mostly because it's out of budget to use all of the features. But I appreciate what I do get to use. Thanks!",4
"September 12, 2021",Love this app. Wish there could be a free report. Finally saw the hours I am sleeping.,5
"September 17, 2021",An app claiming to detect REM sleep through sound alone makes me question the integrity of its creators.,2
"October 14, 2021",I'm unable to subscribe to this app because it keeps rejecting my password for my payment method. Even though I verified it at least 12 times now..,1
"September 25, 2021","We're helpful, good IO. Only reason is not five stars is because sometimes it fails to collect the data on my Pixel.",4
"September 24, 2021",Easy to understand and use but the pop up ads are annoying.,3
"October 23, 2021",Hey I have been useing this app more tham a week I used this just to trak my rem sleep but there is no meter of rem sleep it's only awake light sleep and dep sleep I would be relly nice to add that feature but I am also think that the pink bars r the rem sleep,4
"January 9, 2022",It's cool but then u have to pay for extra services.,3
"September 28, 2021",There are soo many ads that you can't even use the app. You even get an ad if you check the app during you sleep cycle.,1
"August 22, 2021",I really love this app because it tracks what I say in my sleep and is really helpful because my friends and mum say I snore so now if I do snore I will know there either lying or not 😂 Kezzia Vlogs 😁,5
"September 19, 2021",Seems to monitor the noises well. May need to work on ambient levels of fans to filter,5
"August 29, 2021",I love this app and it help me with my sleep and sounds and audio sound it record the sleep snoring and I love it,5
"October 29, 2021","At this price, it has to work with wearables. Let me know when it does.",3
"August 26, 2021",Audio ads in the middle of the night. Peddling online dating. W. T. F. Uninstall forever.,1
"January 15, 2022",Only used it once so far but this is a fantastic app,5
"January 4, 2022",Wish I had know upfront that this is a paid app.,2
"September 16, 2021",It seems to give a little background noise sometimes but I love this app,5
"October 20, 2021",This app is good but i just wish you didn't need to subcribe for all the good stuff on the app but all in all this app is great,5
"October 17, 2021",Scared someone is violating me in my sleep so I downloaded this app so far disturbed at the audio recordings because it picks up on everything and so far confirms my fears. Thank you for making this app and making it mostly free.,5
"October 17, 2021",Easy to use. Great to analyze your sleep patterns.,4
"November 13, 2021",I'm trying the free option. I can only view two days results. Is there a way to see more?,3
"August 9, 2021",this app is great it goes perfectly with my sleep you can see your sleep time too.,5
"August 10, 2021",Easy to use and fun to hear the recordings :),5
"December 11, 2021",A very useful & amazing app...Thank you,5
"October 20, 2021","2 nights in a row. I'm trying to understand what's contributing to my fibromyalgia. Circadian rhythms are not good for fibromyalgia sufferers. This helps so much. I got real sleep last night and I have the documents to prove it 🥰😆 I'm curious, what do the pink lines on the graph mean? Yellow is awake, green is light and blue is deep. What is pink?",5
"September 13, 2021",So app good at knowing when I'm awake asleep in light sleep . But apps not free like it said it was,3
"November 9, 2021","""The app keeps stopping"" error",1
"November 16, 2021","Not free, and wasn't what I was looking for",2
"October 3, 2021",Great easy app to use and works plus buy on but I use free 1 and its great,5
"September 29, 2021",There's no alarm sound and sometimes it doesn't even vibrate:(,2
"September 15, 2021",I like the functions overall so far. Haven't subscribed to the pro version yet BTW.,5
"November 16, 2021",Hopefully the team is looking into exporting the data into a csv file for the pro users!,5
"December 22, 2021",This could saves lives just downloaded gonna try it out I will post update for now one star,1
"November 1, 2021",I guess I do snore. A fun app that reveals your actions in bed.,5
"August 17, 2021","I like this app, but there is no way to add missing sleep afterwards",4
"August 18, 2021",Why is this app saying I had 0 minutes of deep sleep and REM even though I slept well?,4
"December 29, 2021",Pay to hear what I do when I sleep why? Seriously!,1
"November 1, 2021",Must start subscription to even try the program. Forget it.,1
"November 7, 2021",Good app helps me fall asleep.,5
"October 2, 2021",It's a good app online using it a few nights it will be interesting to monitor my sleep,5
"January 16, 2022",My alarm was at 9:00 and i woke up at 9:01 it is amazing download it please,5
"September 19, 2021","The sleep monitoring on my phone says I fell asleep, and only had light sleep for 8 hours. Is there a requirement for it to work? I had it beside me at night.",4
"December 12, 2021",I always wondered how well I was sleeping. Thanx for coming up with this!,5
"December 24, 2021","Lures users into watching ads through a ""Christmas gift"" notification.",1
"January 14, 2022",The app is not really accurate and it doesn't know how to filter the sounds. It can recognize dogs barking and cars outside but it doesn't recognize my snors; which I know I have bc my mom is always telling me about how she can hear it across the rooms (lol). Also the more interesting features are paid so the app doesn't really have much usage if you don't pay for it.,2
"January 14, 2022",Love that records me snoring.,5
"January 2, 2022","Nowadays, I think I know why at times I wake up tired.",5
"October 14, 2021","Good, it's useful, easy to use and fascinating",4
"September 7, 2021","Love it so much, it helps me keep track of everything!",5
"December 23, 2021",Bit expensive but it's worth it,4
"September 4, 2021","This is the best app that can make me sleep fastly and make me release stress when sleep .🥰🥰...thanks for make this app , i loves it .💞",5
"December 30, 2021",The very second to open the app you find out that everything costs money. I didn't even get the opportunity to try it out before they made me pay. What's sad is I am actually willing to pay for apps I will pay the amount they asked to absolutely and willingly but I want to know it works first. ** I think it's very weird that there's so many good reviews for an app that cost $30 a year at minimum. **,1
"January 3, 2022","As a paid subscriber for more than a year, I would rate it below average , 7 out of 10 times, the app crashes and displays a msg data is lost. Performs very inconsistently. Won't recommend it. Customer service sucks.",2
"December 2, 2021","First 10 seconds of opening the app i was greeted with 3 different prompts to get their ""Premium Sevice"". I did not even get a chance to look at what the app offers and play with it. The next 30 seconds I was playing with 2 menu options and received 2 ads. No a good experience at all you will no be taking my money and I just unistalled the app because that is preditory application behavior. I will review again if this is fixed but until than try a different app.",2
"August 27, 2021",Its so cool it can know when I'm in REM.,5
"November 28, 2021",Helped me to realise that I have an unhealthy sleeping habit which allowed me to improve it,5
"August 20, 2021","First few nights were great, now sleeping tracking was lost. Uninstalling.",1
"January 15, 2022","This automatically deletes older recording, even if i add them to favorites. There should be a way to save favorites without having to buy premium.",3
"January 12, 2022",Inconsistent alarm. Really not worth having if the alarm goes off between 1/3 and 2/3 of the time. Otherwise seems like it would be exactly what I was looking for.,3
"January 3, 2022",They demand that you buy the premium and position the ads where you cannot do a thing or click out so you have to either buy the premium or you have to endure all the ads that lock the app down and refuse to allow the app to work worst app I've ever had,1
"August 16, 2021",I just love this app. Never knew I take so much in my sleep.,5
"October 26, 2021",The first thing the app does is selling me a 30 dolar premium.,1
"November 7, 2021",Great app. Thank you!,5
"September 2, 2021","Horrible app. Won't record anything most times with a report that starts recording for 5 minutes, and the rest is blank until the end of the night you wanted to record. This app is junk. Don't waste your time, just go find another sleep app that works like you would expect a sleep app to work. Add this one to the gargantuan pile of worthless apps.",1
"September 18, 2021","This app works like a charm, gentle wake ups, good time keeping, and I haven't even paid for it yet! I use this app every night to track how I sleep. The fact that I have different options as to what I did during the day gives me quite an accurate read as to how I slept at night. Keep up the great work!!!Added bonus, the developers are responsive to use feedback.",5
"September 19, 2021","I was skeptical about the alarm but it wakes. The sleep tracker also seems accurate. After two nights, I'm probably sold on this app. Less groggy, and the wake-up is less startling. Hope it continues to please. I JUST want to say it is brilliant. I've always been a deep sleeper and struggled waking up. It's so much better now! Thank you!",5
"September 21, 2021","As someone with sleep issues, I really enjoy Sleep Monitor; it’s super easy to dive into the details - the use of colors and graphs communicates information in a way that’s very informative and easy to interpret. I enjoy looking at the trends over a week or month’s time as well. If I feel refreshed Sleep Monitor indicates I got plenty of deep or quality sleep, if I feel lousy the results show me why. At last, I don't think we should enjoy any service for free. Good job!",5
"August 5, 2021","Installed as the reviews and nearly 5 stars, not sure why?? woke up to annoying music, couldn't turn it off and it got loud, and whilst try to turn it off, it then said report, but was so annoyed, dismissed it, now can't get it back , thanks but no thanks, so couldn't see any sleep report or nothing, and just like most other apps, having to pay premium and won't let you try it out first",1
"September 28, 2021","I wanted this app to work well, I even paid for the subscription but for the past week I have used this app I needed it to wake me up and it did not do so the first time no alarm and no vibration. Then the second time it started vibrating, still no alarm but this time my phone completely froze and would not respond to anything. I think after a minute of not responding and vibrating it restarted itself. I Uninstalled it after that.",1
"December 1, 2021","This app is very useful. It gave me a lot of insight about how good I sleep. My one issue is that I wish I could have some sort of slider on the graph to show when the stuff happened. Other than that, it's great",4
"September 20, 2021",Very useful to understand my sleeping patterns,5
"July 27, 2021","I got this app and finally I had concrete evidence that explained exactly why I felt the way I did. Then 6 months ago, my schedule changed and I needed to wake each day by 6am. I felt like a train wreck. Absolutely terrible and in physical and emotional pain all day long. Results showed I was averaging between 2-4 hours a night. Maybe 1-2 nights a week I’d get 6 hours. I had chronic sleep deprivation and how I felt was obviously perfectly normal.",5
"August 1, 2021",Unhappy! First and foremost it billed me for a 1 yr subscription when I selected monthly billing of $2.99/mo. I thought I'd try the full app for a month and cancel depending on how well it worked for me... Surprise! I was billed for a full yr! My main reason for even trying was to record snoring. The audio recordings are not very robust and record only in increments of 1 min. Not happy with this app or the bait and switch on the billing.,1
"August 21, 2021","I currently used it for thus night snd i csnt turn it off, i slide up it wont turn off it is very irritading",1
"July 27, 2021",Great App. I paid for a lifetime sub to premium. Upgraded to a new phone and the restore feature says I never made a purchase. Not paying twice. Feels like a scam. *edit* They fixed the issue I had after am email exchange. The app is definitely worth downloading. It works as advertised.,5
"November 15, 2021","They try to trick you into subscribing to the app for £25 a month. It would have done it instantly if I had been resting my finger on the fingerprint reader. Very scummy, do not install.",1
"August 1, 2021","I am happy with the app.but i cannot get the pro upgrade! It.appears that the only way to.uograde is through Google pay. And I refuse to be locked into a single financial tool, period, exclamation point! If there was a way that i could pay with a credit card, the rating would be a 5÷. Ray Ergenbright",3
"January 21, 2022","Immediately wants money. No trial period to see if it is what I'm looking for my health. Great rating, bad customer service choice.",1
"July 31, 2021","DO NOT INSTALL. Inflexible, forces unnecessary permissions to ""work"" and harvest personal health information (HIPAA violations galore). Forces outrageously overpriced subscription model (you never stop paying for an app that offers nothing that can't be obtained from free apps). I immediately uninstalled this app and will be filing a report against the company for violating people's HIPAA privacy rights. It's a $10,000 fine per violation... How many users have downloaded this app again?)",1
"November 21, 2021",As described. Excellent app.,5
"December 6, 2021",One of best app love it..,5
"December 10, 2021",Too many ads. I go to turn off the tracker in the morning and it just starts playing an ad with a bright screen and loud volume. Not how I want to wake up,1
"September 30, 2021","Highly Innacurate. I'm pregnant, and was curious how much sleep I actually get at night. I woke up 5 times, going to the bathroom each time, sitting up in bed, making noises, making movements, up for 5-10 each time, and even went downstairs once for a glass of warm milk and a banana. The app told me I woke up once for about 2 minutes. It also said that I had deep sleep most of the time, and light sleep a very little bit of time. I slept a total of 7 hours and 51 minutes according to the app.",1
"January 10, 2022","This app is amazing better than an other app I had but back to what I was talking about I love this app tho I did not hear if I was saying anything or not or anything else so please fix that. Thank you Respectfully yours, Mya",5
"August 16, 2021",Great free version! Makes me want to upgrade,5
"October 28, 2021","Says I slept for 1 hour last night, which is incorrect lol... Uninstalling.",1
"December 9, 2021",I am no longer able to use my subscription to this app with the phone I have now. But I wonder if there is any way to still open or view records from when I was using the app? Great app for many reasons 🙏,5
"August 3, 2021","This app was ok to start with until it froze this morning, the alarm was going and would not turn off, the volume kept turning itself to loud when I tried to lower it, had to restart my phone to kill the app, so uninstalled.",3
"September 27, 2021","This app was awful. Upon launching it, it immediately assaults you with ads. Only after does it give you a very forced sleep tracker, which when trying to change the settings of, throws more ads at you. Would not reccomend.",1
"January 5, 2022",Helped me fix my messy sleep schedule 😁,5
"August 10, 2021",Make it so you can edit the sleep log after we put it in for more accuracy.,4
"September 25, 2021",The app itself shows like it has a lot of potential but for whatever reason Android does not let the permission it needs so it can run full-time while you're sleeping so that kind of piece of purpose.,2
"December 21, 2021",Useless without buying premium plan. Can't even turn alarm off in the morning without watching an ad.,1
"September 11, 2021",I love this app my little body is slepp better for scholl for 5th i love it,5
"October 1, 2021",I didn't like it because there is an annoying ad immediately that wants you to sign up for the monthly service for what seems to be basic functions. I uninstalled after about 10 minutes.,1
"August 19, 2021","its okay but i wish you could define what level of volume you want to record, because i just get hundreds of recordings of my fan spinning, which i dont care about - i want to hear the louder things like snoring and talking!",3
"October 18, 2021","Dodgy adverts on first run to trick people into subscribing - 'discount only available now', 'new user discount, only x remaining'. Bad practices and sets up that the app is untrustworthy. Deleted straight away.",1
"July 13, 2021","This app is great!! I talk in my sleep, a lot!! I often wake other family members during the night with my dreamtalk and screaming but I rarely remember my dreams. This app has opened my eyes not only to what I dream about but has also been beneficial in figuring out what may be causing my most active and talkative dreams. Plus, it's hilarious to listen to the crazy stuff your dreams are made of. 🤣",5
"January 6, 2022",Stats are unfortunalety inaccurate. Can't rely on this app. The app has a pleasant design.,1
"October 28, 2021","1st night of using this, so far so good",5
"April 8, 2021","I have been suspecting that I may suffer from sleep apnea. This app is amazing. It enables me to hear how often I am having blockage that may lead to poor sleep quality. The data it collects is very helpful to me. I use sleep monitor every night since I struggle with sleeping regularly. When I say I struggled, I mean I would go to sleep at 2-4am and then wake up at 2 or so pm, continuously throughout the week. I’m still trying to transition into a proper sleep schedule so I use this app to record sleep time and wake up time, my sleep quality has been increasing over the past week so I’m hopeful. I recommend this app to anyone struggling with sleeping, because I tell you, I used to be one of the worst sleepers ever, and this has actually helped.",5
"April 8, 2021","I really love this app! It’s so easy to use, and I have the premium. It’s worth EVERY penny. I know this is doing good things for my sleep. I’ve found it really helpful especially in tracking my sleep patterns over time. All the tracking helps me improve sleep because I can see time trends and adjust my sleep/wake times to be more optimal. All my sleep data that I accumulated over the past 1 year are saved in Pro version. I see changes. This data backup extra feature is important to me!!! It can be really surprising to see what some positive and negative factors are as well, and that’s definitely provided me some good sleep insight. Thanks!",5
"November 21, 2021",Four ads upon start up with the fourth one being completely unable to close. Terrible.,1
"February 9, 2021","Brilliant app ,you can use almost all of the features without paying which all other similar apps don't allow. It's given me a clear picture of my sleep patterns and has helped me so much.I have changed my bedtime routine and feel all the better for doing it. I would definitely recommend this app and listening to yourself snoring or talking while asleep is really funny,you can't do that with any other app without paying. Definitely 5 stars",5
"April 24, 2021","I knew that I had poor sleep averaging about five hours or less a night. Seeing the results and analysis in vivid color stirred me to strive to the recommended goals of deep and efficient sleep. Consistent with the Sleep app data, I feel great and am at my best when I hit the targets. Get the app and become informed. Yes, our parents told us to go to bed at night, but with all there is. “To do”, it’s a unique challenge for this and future generations. Hopefully I can reverse the years of sleep deprivation and lengthen my life expectancy.",5
"November 26, 2019","Not what I was expecting, usually apps like this allow me to actually listen to the audio after it's been recorded. Theres absolutely no way to hear anything. They show you a tiny bar with a few different colors indicating the ""level of sleep you're at"" once you awake. In my opinion there are better apps out there with the same features as this app but better because you can listen to the audio that was recorded. This ap has 3 nice free ""lullabies"" to listen to while falling asleep. That's it.",2
"August 13, 2021","I liked it because you could unlock a different sleep sound by watching a video now it just constantly pops up the ad to purchase a subscription, ended up deleting the app.",1
"September 20, 2021",It gives you very accurate sleep patterns love this app,5
"April 8, 2021","This app is the best sleep tracker you will find out there. I’m giving it five stars. I’ve only used your app for 5 nights. I’m learning a lot. It works great to keep track of sleep/wake times, snoring, how much deep sleep I got. I’m pleased with my results so far as it’s better than I thought it would be. I feel like most nights I fall asleep fast 5-7 min and your app agrees. One night I’m sure I laid there for an 40 min-1 hour not sleeping and your app detected that. It detects REM sleep for me as well. Also the sleep takings!!!I know I have entered this part of sleep as I have had dreams, just wondered how it's picked it up. How does the app/phone know what my sleep is doing, it's fascinating!",5
"April 13, 2021","Interesting app to monitor sleep quality. Amazing, I have been using for more than a year so far, better understanding my sleep quality and evolution over the time. For instance which are the week days I sleep better or worse; hours of sleep; at what time do I start sleeping. I like the audio recording feature very much. This is an excellent tool because help me recording my sleep history to shows to my Doctor in order to get some solution to avoid bother others with snoring. Thanks!",5
"June 30, 2021",I think a person is best rested if they maximize their deep sleeping capabilities. This app has been allowing me to do that. The app can be pretty fun too with the sleep talking capability. I don't sleep talk myself but my cats are always sent setting it off in the middle of the night. The app can also track how many times you have to get up and use the bathroom. This allows you to fine-tune your diet so you sleep more effectively throughout the night. This is a great and very useful app.,5
"June 29, 2021",Awesome sleep application！My friend recommended this app one day because we were talking about sleep and I was having trouble sleeping. I can now see the results of my sleeping habits and understand why some days I feel great while sometimes I feel tired. This app is very non intrusive and gentle so I’m not stressed about sleep . All the settings and instructions are simple to understand and use. I’m sleeping and waking better. Thank you for creating and sharing a very useful app.,5
"June 28, 2021","I used it once, or so I thought. The time I used it it didn't record anyting. Then out of the blue it decided to set off the alarm which was at the max speaker volume, no volume control, no notification popped up saying that the alarm for this app was going off, and when I found the app and tried to open it nothing happened so I had to uninstall it immediately to get the alarm to finally shut off. Totally freaked me out. Sorry but not taking any chances that it would happen again.",1
"October 21, 2020","I personally LOVE this app!!! I've only used it for 2 nights and decided to buy the full version. Not only does it show when you are in a deep or light sleep, but it records the sounds around you. It picked up my fan, the rain outside, vehicles going down the road and me snoring! I always take my phone with me if I wake up to go to bthrm or get a drink so it picked up on the fact I woke up. Definitely would recommend!",5
"April 16, 2021","I really love this app, but wish it had a function similar to iPhone’s “do not disturb” where you can select to allow phone calls to come through while still muting texts and other alerts. I’m basically on-call 24 hours for my job and like to sleep through the night but need phone calls to come through for emergencies.",5
"April 13, 2021","Some people write negative responses but even if the data wouldn't be accurate, I still believe it's interesting to see the sleep quality which in my view seems to reflect how I feel in the morning. Great that the snoring detection is added. I know now that I snore and can even hear it. Well done. Would be great if the app could also measure if one sleeps lying steady or moving around all the time, a grade for peaceful sleep or worried sleep. I usually leave my phone on the charger when using th",5
"April 22, 2021","Great Experience! Gorgeous interface, great use of colors. Various visualizations such as charts to track history; slice bar for a snapshot; index score for overall quality of sleep; sleep debt tracked, all of which I would need to a deep dive to understand for further value. Recordings to understand sleep talking, snoring, maybe even sleep apnea. | SUGGESTION 1. Be able to edit, trim or cut out phone noises from recordings.",4
"March 17, 2021","Tried this out, and it told me I got a fantastic night's sleep, and didn't wake up once. Which is not true because I woke up about 3/4 times during the night and checked my phone to see the time so I could compare it to the app. Turns out it must have recorded those times I picked up my phone as ""snoring"" or other sleep noises. I never expected miracles from just some free app, though I am surprised about all the other positive reviews.",1
"January 7, 2021","This app works wonderfully for what I need it to do. (I use the free verison.) You can track waking and sleeping times, noises during the night, and what impacts your sleep. My only complaint is that the alarm never goes off, so I have to set one through a different app. It isn't a big deal, but it is bothersome. All in all though, I reccommend this for sleep tracking!",4
"August 22, 2020","Reasonable, but inaccurate and buggy. I initially loved this app because it split down your sleep types, but after a period of time I noticed that it wasn't accurately capturing awake periods. In addition, if you woke early before alarm and stopped the ""sleep"" the alarm would still go off and you couldn't turn it off!! So annoying, I've now uninstalled.",2
"June 26, 2021","I have only had this app for a short time, but being a sufferer of night terrors and lucid dreams it's interesting to hear what I do in my sleep; another great part of this app that while it's a little more time consuming to use the free version you aren't at all forced into buying the full version to access everything like with most of these apps.",5
"April 21, 2021","Far and away the App I use and appreciate the most. I’m an engineer, so direct, measured data means everything to me. Sleep is so vital to our overall physical, mental and emotional well being, and this app helps me track and make adjustments to help improve my sleep. Also helps me understand what’s going in with my stress levels and physical health. My day starts off with much more effectively because of this app.",5
"May 7, 2020","It worked wonderful for the first couple of days, but now it keeps thinking that I'm awake all night and every time I go to turn it on for the night it's already up and running and has pretty much tried to keep track of my sleep the whole day. Even if I close the app after stopping the sleep session and reopen it, it still acts as if the sleep session never ended and says I've been awake for ~22 hours. I would really like to know how I sleep, and this is getting inconvenient, as I pay for this.",3
"April 2, 2020","I used to really like the app, the first week or so was great but since then things have gone downhill in the quality of feedback I'm getting. For instance, it used to run all night and in the morning I could turn it off and see how I slept (awake, rem, and deep sleep were very scattered and it recorded a lot of sound). Now it turns itself off after a few hours, and the information is really reallly bad. No sleep noises, 'awake' the majority of the night I slept through.. this update broke it.",2
"February 26, 2020","This app is really useful for tracking my sleep patterns and how well I sleep (especially when I feel like I'm king of the world but my tired body says otherwise). I also fall asleep really easily to the sounds you can play, coming from somebody who has a really hard time falling asleep at night. Overall I'd say this app has definitely improved my nighttime life, and I'd 100% recommend it to anyone debating on downloading this app. (PS I don't have the paid version but it's still amazing!)",5
"July 1, 2021","Accurate and incredibly insightful. I am impressed. I had no idea I had so many instances of snoring, and got to hear and see how frequently I do actually snore. Not only has this helped me gain insight as to why I wake up tired, but now I actively manage my habits before bedtime and can actually measure the success with this app. Truly one of those well-thought-out applications that actually can improve your life. Bravo!",5
"July 27, 2021",Does not record any of my sleep talk/night terrors... every recording is just white noise... and I kept the phone right next to me and gave the app all the oermissjons it needed to run properly,1
"April 3, 2020","This is the best sleeper app that I've used so far. They have the best free version, which makes me want to subscribe to their membership plan. Would definitely recommend! I didn't realize some of the weird noises I made in my sleep, either... Apparently sometimes when I sleep, I sound like the lady from The Grudge, pretty crazy!!! Thanks for an amazing app, SM Health Team!!! 😍👍🏼❤",5
"November 2, 2020","Does everything you want it to do. Only two criticisms. 1. On the Sleep noises, the dashed lines aren't reflective of the actual noise you make. It would be very useful if those dashed lines on the sound bites reflected the noise level. 2. With the free version it'll delete data older than 7 days unless you pay. They say it's to reduce space. The space is on my phone that I payed for. It would make more sense if you restricted the analytics to payed version. That's honestly BS.",4
"September 17, 2021",Everything is on track that's why I love it Thank you So much,5
"July 25, 2021","I’ve used this app for a couple nights now and the tracking seems to work well (first night seemed wrong but now it’s better). It shows a very regular cycle: light -> deep -> light -> REM, repeat (with lots of waking in between), but i wonder if this is a sign of accuracy or it’s just the tracker’s priors overwhelming any actual signal. I’ll have to check out the FAQ I guess.",5
"October 10, 2021","Installed it and first button I press takes me to a payment page to buy the app, I click it away and get to another payment page. I don't enjoy the money grabbing attitude.",1
"April 8, 2021","First of all I want to congratulate you for this app and thank you for having released it almost totally for free. I've been using it for the past three days and I noticed something funny. Me and my partner used Sleep Monitor last night together.This morning we had a giggle listening to ourselves snoring lol, we picked up a few sounds that were the same at the same time but because both of our phones picked it up, we don’t know which one of us made the noise, am I doing something wrong? Hope I can get back from you.",5
"April 24, 2021","I bought this app hoping it would be able to let me have a better look into my sleep patterns, and it has done more than I hoped for. It tracks all the aspects of sleep that I want tracked, such as quality sleep and deep sleep. It is pretty darn accurate as far as knowing when I’m awake but laying still, when I wake up in the middle of the night, and when I get up in the morning. Overall, I would suggest this app over any other sleep app.Also there is a sound recorder feature, which is veru good, I can better track my sleep apnea.",5
"April 24, 2021","I downloaded the app because I was told that I talk in my sleep. I didn’t really think that the app would catch anything I said but it totally did! I’ve used it every night for the last week, and it was able to catch around 10 funny clips, some of them gibberish and some clear as day as if I was awake! Highly reccommend. :)",5
"July 25, 2021","The app seems to do fairly well tracking my sleep and confirming what I already suspected (that I wake up a lot and don’t get enough deep sleep), but it falls short in two key areas:1. There is no advice on how to address your sleep issues. They sell products but there are no recommendations for your particular patterns. 2. No support for smart watches",5
"April 16, 2021","I’ve been using it for well over a year. If find that it’s pretty accurate in showing when I wake up during the night and when I’m in deep sleep, when I snore etc. I like this sleep monitor app. A question for the dev: is it possible to add a feature in the future that automatically links my sleep data to “my partner’s” device?",5
"December 19, 2019","I love the app but when I go to bed 10-1 it always starts actually monitoring at 4 am and it's kinda annoying. I mean the first time it worked all the way and the second time it didn't work at all and the third time it said it was only a second and then the rest, 3 other days, it started at 4 and it's annoying, but besides that this is good, I'm still on the fence if it's real or not tho.",3
"July 13, 2021","I just tried the sleep tracking functionality on my phone. I went to bed at 23:00 and press the start to sleep button, and of cause the sleep analysis shows that I started to sleep at 23:00! And thissleep monitoring / sleep report application is very basic. I expected something more because nowadays the cheap fitness trackers have more sophisticated sleep report. Maybe, I did't have any REM phase sleep, because I did not recognise even a second of it, but I doubt it.",5
"May 14, 2020","Removed. Even though I was repeatedly set it for PM, it kept reverting to telling me to go to bed in AM. Um. No. Also, I don't like how there's no more detailed breakdown of the over night time frame. It's great to see the little color blocks of activity, but it would be nice if I could zero in on a specific time, 1:30 am, for example.",3
"June 7, 2021","This has also become one of my favourite apps. I was able to start tracking my sleep. Over the next week, I learned what the bits and pieces meant to increase its accuracy and tried out Sleep Monitor's new alarm to wake up with; it was an enjoyable process of discovery and I now have a very accurate sleep monitor that lets me know when I have a sleep debt, how long it takes me to get to sleep, how consistent I have been with regular bed times and wake times, what the quality of my sleep is.",5
"April 16, 2021","It’s scary how accurate this app is. I fall asleep with the TV on, timer set to 30 minutes, but I’m usually asleep in 10 minutes. I wake up 5 minutes before the alarm goes off. I don’t sleep with anyone, human or animal, in the same room. I'm glad to see all the activities are registered in this app. My wish list for this app is to...allow for hitting “sleep” a second time for the alarm clock so you can decide to go back to sleep if you haven’t gotten enough.",5
"March 24, 2021",I don't review much. I love the concept and wish there were better apps. I had this app for barely a week. Out of no where after 3 uses my phone started acting up. Not opening over half my apps. I deleted it yesterday and now I can get back on my other apps. Not 100%sure if it was the case. But doesn't set right when everything works again after it was removed. Because i nearly had to factory reset and lose everything. Yeah deserves 1 star.,1
"June 4, 2021",This app is too good. The depth of analysis and data it provides is simply mind blowing. Worth every penny. I’m not sure if this is helping my sleep but it certainly gives an incredibly detailed description of what’s going on and it has made me a lot more aware of my sleep and the importance of it. It would be great to have a section of ‘better sleep tips’. Other than a fantastic app. Thank you.,5
"June 29, 2021","I've been using this for months-- maybe even a year? I love the options for a gradual alarm, that you can decide how large of a window to wake you within, like half an hour. I wish soon it will actually wake me when I am in the shallower part of my sleep cycle. The generated sleep data is helpful as well. The graph and report are easy to understand. It is really amazing that the night sounds like snoring and dream talks can be saved on the phone. Interesting! I'd definitely recommend it.",5
"October 22, 2021",Too inaccurate times when I know I've been awake it says light sleep,2
"December 27, 2019",Doesn't monitor snoring (or at least I cannot find a way to turn it on even after googling for help). set an alarm for 8:30 which never went off. The actual sleep that has been monitored cannot be looked at in more detail (e.g. expanding the graph to see how long I was awake in the night). I just haven't found this app useful,2
"April 8, 2021","I love this app! Last night, I got the best sleep I have had in a extremely long time.I getting almost 10 hours of sleep I would say that’s a pretty good nights sleep. However the best way to really use the app is learning what a good night looks like for me; over time I start to notice patterns. On nights when I felt like I got a great nights sleep note what the graph looks like; do the same for poor nights. Over time I begin to learn the patterns and what makes a good/poor night for me. I would definitely recommend this for my friends. Thank you so much for making this amazing app!",5
"April 8, 2021","Hello, I downloaded this app around two weeksago. The statistical elements of the app are unique and very helpful, and In terms of improvements, I wish it were able to detect when I fall asleep as it can give a bit of a false reading as to how long I have been in bed verses how long I have been asleep. Otherwise, an awesome app!",5
"June 22, 2021","This is an all-in-one sleep tracking app that allows me free to use. I can see sleep reports, I can hear my sleep sounds and it can do much more! You can also add emoji tags and notes to each day if you want to go back through your data and analyse it (although there is no way to say that you’re on your period via the emoji tags but you can say you had meds, exercised, drank alcohol etc.). I’m sure there are loads of other cool features that I am yet to discover, but I like it so far!",5
"July 16, 2021","Pretty good, but a few problems. 1. The alarm clock is terrible. My biggest complaint is it still goes off if you have turned the monitor off. I think it could also sunrise, and work on sleep duration (e.g after x hours of sleep). 2. The app doesn't seem to keep recordings for split sleep, at least that I can see on the graphs, meaning if I sleep for 4 hours, get up for 6, and repeat, this is my problem. 3. I don't like that it asks me how I feel when I wake, ask me in an hour when I'm awake.",4
"July 9, 2021",A very cool app. It's cool to look back on all the things you do at night. I have a question for the developer though. How does the app know when you're in rem sleep seeing as it's based on eye movement? Also sometimes I forget to stop the app once I've woken up. It thinks my sleep has lasted 16 hours now. Maybe once it's detected you've been awake for a certain amount of time it stops automatically?,5
"July 21, 2021","Recently I've come to use it quite often, it's easy to use aswell with basic and usefull features for the regular user. Tho I cannot give it a good score because the alarm sound sometimes keeps going even after I've pressed the stop button aswell as restarted the app (even the phone). Had to manually go into the app setting to turn the alarm feature of.",3
"April 22, 2021","Very accurate. I didn’t realize how my sleep was effected by certain things (like alcohol) until I started tracking it. I was always tired no matter how much sleep I got and just figured that the way things are. I started using this to track my sleep and realized I was getting almost no deep sleep and around 6.5 hours total sleep a night. After experimenting with sleep times / wake times, and dietary adjustments I now clock about 7:35 hrs of sleep every night with an avg of 2.5-3hrs deep sleep. I am more well rested and finally no tired all the time thanks to this app!",5
"March 9, 2021","In summary I would 100% recommend this app. This app is very helpful and interesting.It has so many cool, free features too. For instance, how it shows when and for how long you woke up in the night. I also like the feature that shows how many times and when you snored, talked, farted, and chattered you’re teeth. My only complaint would be that you have to pay for the premium. However it is only $20+ a year. So it’s not bad.",5
"April 25, 2020",It is a good app and it tracks your sleep well. Sometimes it says there is no rem sleep. The music is good and got me to sleep easy. I slep well with this app and so did my sister. I recemond it to everyone with bad sleep or sleep disorders that cant sleep. It also has an alarm you can set for when you wake up. Overall I think it is a 4/5 because there is things you have to pay for. But it is still good for me and some people the need sleep monitor like this one.,5
"April 22, 2021",The app is great but I have found it to be quite glitchy. More often than not I start the recording and it somehow stops or 'irregularly' records through the night. Sometimes I'll turn the recording off in the morning and when I go to start the new recording that evening it has somehow continued recording and thinks I've slept for 24 hours. I've uninstalled and reinstalled a few times to try and fix this issue.,3
"April 17, 2021","I would say this was worth any small amount of money that it costs. Paying for premium, or even just the basic app is the best way to analyze your sleep. It’s such an easy well made app to use that I honestly can’t wait to wake up every morning and see all the data this little app picks up in one night. It’s amazing and definitely worth the money !!🙏🙏",5
"April 11, 2021",Been using for over 6 months. First thing I look at when I wake up. It usually tells me how I’m going to feel that day depending on how much sleep I got. Great info laid out in a great charts and graphs. I've never seen anything like it. If i could rate this above 5 stars I would. purchase is not at all necessary but i bought the full version anyway just to support the developers.,5
"July 25, 2021","Sleep Monitor will be a valuable app! PS My Phone is about 1 yr old & works very well. If the sensor could locate your upper body ALL night, then the results would be valid & usable by my doctor. EVERY morning when I wake & check the data on the graph & time circle, I am so meticulous about where the phone is placed & am paranoid about my body position or blankets. Even though I’m trying to sleep, now I’m waking to glance at the screen in order to see if data is being recorded or not!",5
"June 23, 2021","Love it buttttt, I wish there was a way to edit your finished sleep tracker. Sometimes it wouldn't register that I had finished sleeping and when I stopped it in the morning and come back to it that night, it'd say that it's still tracking my sleep even tho I know I stopped it that morning. It's annoying. And it's happened 4 times now",5
"April 23, 2021","I do really enjoy this app (even as a free user) but I run into one sort of significant issue: REM sleep tracking doesn't seem to be quite accurate yet. I find it really hard to believe I've only gotten 0-5 minutes of REM sleep a night for the last week on a pathological level. I am more restless than most for sure, but it still seems odd. Hope this can be optimized for! *The little sleep tips are also quite nice and educational!",4
"March 11, 2020","Such a good app! It tells you your rem, when you were awake in the middle of the night if you were like me, light sleep, and deep sleep. The only thing is that it records the noises you make which is grammatically incorrect for me it was recording it's own lullabies. That's why I rate it a 4/5 but it does alot of awesome things!!",4
"March 9, 2021","I really like the sleep montior app. It's plain and simple. It is useful to be able to manually add in sleep when it's happened unexpectedly, i.e. a nap on the sofa. However, there isn't a widget or a quickset function. Will there ever be any of those options in the near future? I will to pay for the widget and / or a quickset function.",5
"July 18, 2021","I love this app and the sounds. It helped me fall asleep so quickly. My only complaint is that I can no longer get the timer to work. Disappointing that you have to keep pushing the play button. The timer originally worked when I bought the yearly subscription 7 months ago, but 2 months ago it stopped. I press on the timer icon and nothing comes up.",3
"June 22, 2020","Going into it, I thought that the app wouldn't be able to accurately montoir my sleep. However, it was able to detect when I woke up in the middle of night on multiple occasions. There is also a geature where it rates your nigjt of sleep. Even if it is not accurate, I find myself feeling better rested because I believe I am. Overall very informational and a useful resource.",4
"June 5, 2021","Absolutely amazed about the data it collected, from hours of sleep to heart rate, sleep quality, deep sleep data, everything! Thanks to the information this app has compiled, I have studied it and found my flaws in my sleeping habits, and have corrected them. I am now having better quality sleep for the right amount of time for my body. Very impressed with the functionality and ease of use of this app",5
"April 8, 2021","I really like sleep monitor it's a very good app and i love how you can add factors you did in your day. I use this app to find any factors in particular helps increase or decrease my sleep quality % from the notes. You can select your own criteria such as “ate late,” allows you to track your sleep quality according to your own life. In fact, thanks to this app I discovered statistically that I always sleep worse when I eat after 10 pm. And I like this app also because it keeps track of the total time I spend in bed (which has made me realize it is NOT enough time)! also turn it on airplane mode when I put it in the bed, which has the added benefit of keeping me from staying up all night reading blogs. I am not always in a super deep sleep, the alarm is nice.",5
"July 3, 2021","I like how this app can detect when you fall asleep and wake up. It’s a good app to get when your main goal is tracking your sleep. Moreover, if you’re getting this app to hear yourself talking or snoring, or whatever you do in your sleep please note that it is also a very good choice. Although it will not show all the noise in the night, you can still have most of the loud sounds you get in your bedroom. The alarm is smart, it can wake you up in a set period like 10-30 mins.",5
"June 8, 2021","This is far better than a previous sleep tracking app I’ve used; the information reflects how I feel in the morning & ties-in with what I know of my night. It’s super easy to use, the information is clearly laid-out, and it’s enabling me to alter my habits & behaviour in order to promote a good sleep. Proof that eating before bed, drinking alcohol, or not taking time out to wind-down before bedtime, have a radical negative effect on a restful night’s sleep!",5
"July 25, 2021",I really like this app it worked really well. It did let me know when I was asleep or when I was not. Like a lot of the free features it has. It allow me to use it under their pillows!!! I moved my bed toward the wall and my nightstand is on the other side of the bed now. Since I have a new bed I don’t want to break in the other side. So I sleep by the wall on the side I’ve already been sleeping on for the past week. Good app to records all the sleep events!,5
"July 23, 2021","Liking this app a lot after about a week and a half of use. It’s a little picky about how/where you have it placed so it can “detect” you and track throughout the night, but once you find a good position close enough to you it’s good. My only real feedback I would give right now is that there doesn’t seem to be a way to adjust the volume on my device in regard to the smart alarm feature. I really like this feature and I feel it has reduced my grogginess upon waking",5
"May 21, 2020",This app isn't great. My sleep recordings were deleted so I attempted to contact them and they never responded. I signed up for the subscription hoping doing so would recover my recordings but the subscription offers no added benefit. I contacted the company again and got an auto-response e-mail. 10/10 would not recommend.,1
"July 13, 2021",This has helped so much. I don't dream in REM. In fact I don't always have REM periods. There are times I wake up and have no recall and times I'm in a light sleep but dream I'm awake. As a psychologist and counselor I will also recommend this app to clients. Having insight to there sleep patterns will help us both to understand a bit more about mood fluctuations based on sleep patterns.,5
"April 7, 2021","I didn't know that only 7 records were allowed when not paying. When I was about to mark down my sleep time for last night it told me I already had 7 recordings. A little rediculous if you ask me to pay for more recordings on top of all else. Really liked this one because I need to keep track of my sleep for health reasons, but this is really disheartening. Will be looking for another sleep monitor,, sorry.",1
"January 24, 2021","I rate this a 5 for its outstanding service. It provides people with correct and efficient information explaining the quality and events in your sleep. After my first day using Sleep Monitor, I was able to track my sleeping. For a very cheap price, Pro provides great features making my experience better than ever. Ad free and great for a good night's sleep. Provides calming music at night (optional) and an alarm if needed. I recommend this app to all ages. This was an amazing find. Well done!",5
"August 24, 2020","App looks beautiful and is easy to use, but no option to connect to Google Fit. Graph is only time stamped at the start and finish so I can't see how accurately it's creating the graph from what I independently know about my sleep (eg I woke up and went to the toilet and tossed and turned at 3:15 to 4 but because the phases aren't time stamped I can't see where this is on the graph) I am also very skeptical that it can claim to interpret when my REM sleep is with no wearable input.",3
"June 8, 2021","When I started to have difficulty sleeping, I was often of the impression that I was only getting 2-3 hrs of sleep consistently. Just knowing that made me feelatrocious. Using the sleep app has helped remarkably. I’m still not sleeping well, but at least I have a much more accurate idea of what sleep I’m getting. It’s much more usually 3-5 hrs rather than 2-3 hours and knowing that makes a difference.",5
"March 11, 2020","The amount of deep sleep does not seem realistic, I think it needs work, in a total of 7 hours it said I did 2 minutes of deep sleep so I think the application needs tweaking still on this side of things. It's handy hearing the noises you make in your sleep, might be useful to have sleep cycles to recommend someone when to go to bed too in order to feel more refreshed, just a thought.",3
"April 8, 2021","I especially appreciate the snore recording feature.This is so cool! I know for a fact that I've been shouting and screaming in my sleep, because it woke up my entire family. The app recorded that. Other times it records my cat meowing in the other room. I sleep with my phone next to me.I get to wake-up and hear whatever noise in my background that I dont see or hear at night I did less Snoring I'm shocked it was very quiet in my sleep last night cool",5
"September 3, 2020","Overall, good app! It shows a lot of important details, in an understandable way. It has an alarm clock, too, but I didn't need to use it. Seems like it functions well. I know I sleep like a rock, and that's exactly what showed on the results. It lost a star for me, because it kept recording the noise from my CPAP machine. Little ambient noises like that shouldn't be recorded.",4
"June 28, 2021",I've tried a number of sleep analysis apps and this is the best I've found. So funny finding out what u say in my sleep. The UI update hasa simplified the interface and made the immediate data easy to understand but there is a wealth of further information if you want to dig around. This is highly recommended and the customer support is first class and friendly too.,5
"June 22, 2021","I’ve had this for just about a week and I think I have at last found the perfect sleep tracking application. I’ve tried all sorts of apps in the past, Sleep Monitor provides a wealth of information and, it allows you to edit the details of your night’s sleep to make them more accurate. Also, it is good that the sleep stats extends to REM sleep, not only merely deep and “quality” sleep. Thegraphical interface with its circles is great. I have no hesitation in recommending it.",5
