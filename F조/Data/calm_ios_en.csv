Living life 12,2022-01-21 04:44:42-07:00,5,0,My experience with calm,I started using the app this year to learn more about meditation and healthy balancing it has been an eye-opener for me as I begin to focus more on how to versus the why/when or outcome fabulous you got a try it
J9-71,2022-01-21 03:27:24-07:00,2,0,This app has glitches,"The App itself has glitches, makes it frustrating and not calming or relaxing. Scenes don’t play when you select them. Stories stop playing and when you select play, it does nothing. Wanted to like this but the app makes this more frustrating than it’s worth."

Gangstaman22,2022-01-20 18:22:56-07:00,1,0,Nothing to try for free,I wanted to give this app a try because I notice it advertised. I have trouble sleeping so I thought I would download the app and see what it had to offer. Very disappointed to find out you need to pay $70 for this app to get anything unlocked. I am not about to only try it for a few days for free knowing it is that expensive. I could not try anything to see this was even worth a few dollars. I’m sorry but you cannot expect someone to pay that much. I will just load my own relaxing music and nighttime stories for free.

Susanmary02,2022-01-20 16:27:07-07:00,5,0,Great app.,Great app. I use it for the sleep stories. Sound scapes and meditation pieces don’t help me sleep. I wish posted more sleep stories more often.

Incredible by-product of great instruction. Thank you, Jeff. PS see you shortly on DNP."

usernametaken8405,2022-01-20 08:32:55-07:00,4,0,Needs for feelings,How are you feeling? It shouldn’t take me 2 minutes to decide how I’m feeling because I only have 12 options to choose from. There is more than enough space to add more feelings. Add more feelings and/or give us the option to fill in our own feeling so when we go back we can see our actual feeling not what we’re force you select based on the options given.
Jltdlttmouvtp,2022-01-20 08:20:22-07:00,5,0,EVERYTHING!,There is not one bad thing I can say about this app. ♥️💯
belu mom,2022-01-20 05:31:42-07:00,5,0,Omg so good!!!,So I needed a app for meditation and like my friend was like try Calm. So I said ok I’d try it for a week and I loved it. It even works for sleep stories!
unwellness,2022-01-19 23:47:49-07:00,2,0,"Great app, terrible support",I purchased a lifetime subscription on Android months ago and since then I’ve switched to iOS. According to the faq’s the only way to restore my lifetime subscription that I PAID for is to use that phone only or purchases new subscription. There’s no way to move it to my iOS device and that seems like a sneaky business practice especially for an app that is centered on wellness. 😡
riya123fart,2022-01-19 21:26:42-07:00,5,0,The best,It is also a good app for kids to go to sleep and and relaxing wen you get the chance

rip off12,2022-01-19 20:28:25-07:00,1,0,$,Do you have anxiety? Do you have trouble sleeping? Don’t want to take advantage of all the free alternatives out there?  Well pay $70 dollars to Calm and you’ll get the same experience as you do with those free sites.  Message brought to you be Lebron James
Anya 12 y old,2022-01-19 20:24:55-07:00,5,0,AMAZING! But only if…       P.S. PLEASE BUY PREMIUM CALM! 🤩ITS AMAZING 💆🏽‍♀️💆🏾💆🏻‍♂️,"Calm is an absolutely amazing app! I just got it and I can already tell that’s going to help me immensely with my anxiety! All of my feelings get welled up at night and a meditation is extremely helpful to help release all of that stress that I’m feeling for the upcoming day! However I would like to note, that without premium Calm, you’re not really going to get anything out of the app at all. Now there is nothing wrong with this ! But I just wanted to let everyone know! Please buy the premium Calm!!! There are so many stories, meditations, and stretching sessions available! I highly recommend this app! And I’ve just started! I can’t wait to see what else it has in store! I will write another review if anything changes!"
ebbabuddy,2022-01-19 18:59:02-07:00,3,0,Like it,I like this app but I purchased a lifetime subscription before even trying it out. I benefit much more from Jason Stephenson’s meditations on YouTube. I find that some of the voices on the meditations are annoying to me vs relaxing. I also get lost in my own thoughts as some meditations have too many pauses.

john1234567898,2022-01-19 13:00:39-07:00,1,0,Exuberant cost for a mediocre service,"There are many services that stream better quality music for cheaper or free. Just because the collect “calm” music does not mean it’s anything special. Most music I got was cheesy elevator music. Spotify has way better algorithms and much better selection, imho."
jackieB23_714,2022-01-19 11:21:37-07:00,5,0,My go-to for migraine relief,"I started using this app when a migraine tracker app I was using recommended meditation as a migraine relief method. So glad I did! On days when I have brutal migraine pain, listening to the daily calm or the pain specific lessons helps me to reduce the pain from excruciating to a bearable level. Also once I began exploring the resources available on this app beyond simply pain relief, I have found the series on focus/procrastination to be incredibly helpful professionally, and also greatly enjoy the calming music library! Great app that keeps getting better. This is the only app I have on my phone that I pay for, and it’s worth every dollar."

Teradyl,2022-01-19 08:49:03-07:00,1,0,Terrible offline functionality,"Every time I start a sleep story it immediately downloads 30 mins of the track, and then stops. WHY NOT DOWNLOAD THE ENTIRE THING?!?! This means that if I lose service or put my phone on airplane mode (which helps to make sure you really don’t get bothered) the end of the story doesn’t work. Now you’d think the download button would work but NO IT DOESNT. Even if I press the download button after starting the story it doesn’t work unless I stop the story entirely and restart it…only THEN does it have the end downloaded (not what I want to do when trying to go to sleep). One year ago I got this app and thought eh they’ll fix this. STILL HAVENT FIXED IT. I’m done with Calm, going to headspace if this isn’t fixed soon."
mikethehousekey123,2022-01-19 05:38:10-07:00,3,0,I like it but……….,Ok so to start off I like it but I can barely even use anything. I was trying to do the 7 day sleep meditation but I can only do the first day and I had to repeat the first day over and over and over. All because I didn’t have the premium and the premium is $70 a year. I didn’t want to get it because that would waste my money but everything is locked for premium. So here is what I am thinking that you should do I think you should make it 50/50. Like 50% of the stuff that is locked for the premium and make it not premium so it can be fair to those who don’t have the premium and to those who have it. Now let’s talk about the price we should make it reasonable enough to get and instead of $70 let’s make it 35 dollars so it can be fair and people would be happy if they had the premium or not because they get a reasonable price and they get to use many of the meditations if they have it and if they don’t. Sorry if this was confusing but I want it to be fair because the price and the amount of meditations that you can use without the premium wasn’t fair so I wanted to make it reasonable and fair. So now I want to hear what you have to say because there are many other people that might agree with me but I am wondering if you do too
iaramorton,2022-01-19 03:04:32-07:00,1,0,Leaves a lot to desire,"Not at all what I expected. I find much better sounds to sleep through Alexa or through free videos on YouTube. Frankly, I don’t like it all and regret I wasted money."
Mrs. Bay bays,2022-01-19 01:00:52-07:00,1,0,Cannot access anything without agreeing to pay $70 at the end of a week,"I cannot stand apps like this. I’m scrolling FB at night because I can’t sleep. This ad shows up and ropes you in. Download it and find out the only way you can access ANYTHING is if you agree to a trial and then $70 a year. The entire purpose of apps doing this is because most people forget about what day they have to cancel it by. No, thank you. I’m not agreeing to anything (7 day trial or not) without even being able to use it ONCE first. Extremely disappointing and now it’s 4am and I wasted a good 20-ish mins with this."
Foxyglove,2022-01-18 22:51:27-07:00,5,0,Best bedfellow,"I’ve been a subscriber for over five years and I’ve seen this app grow and expand so beautifully. I don’t know what I would do without Calm, there is rarely a night when I don’t listen to a sleep story. Keep up the great work!!!"
LT1926825,2022-01-18 21:54:36-07:00,5,0,"So helpful for tinnitus, headaches, anxiety post concussion","I’ve suffered from tinnitus (ringing in my ears), migraines, and anxiety since a concussion several years ago. I never pay for apps, but the Calm App is so helpful that, after paying for 1 year, I’ve decided to pay for a lifetime membership. I love that I can choose to listen to a male, as many female voices increase my symptoms. It’s wonderful to have such a vast choice of categories to turn to. I love the 4 to 7 day training sessions for things like decreasing pain, decreasing anxiety, decreasing headaches, and falling asleep. When my tinnitus is bad, I use one of the sleep meditations to help overpower the sound and allow ne to fall asleep. When I have a headache, I lie down and listen to a calming meditation, and the headache resolves, or at least decreases. These guided meditations really help soothe my anxiety. The different daily meditations help teach what to do for various issues, and you can save the ones you especially like. I highly recommend the 30 day Intro to Meditating, as it helps you become adept at meditation. This app is so worth getting!"

techyy,2022-01-18 20:25:42-07:00,1,0,No Free Trial,"I’m surprised that Calm doesn’t have free trial. I tried Headspace and Calm both at the same time. In my opinion, Headspace is much better in terms of the interface design and app contents. I purchased Calm’s annual plan by mistake when I wrongly assumed it comes with free trial. A waste of money."
laemk,2022-01-18 20:03:33-07:00,5,0,Calm,I have used Calm going on two years to help me relax & fall asleep. It works much better than pills without the side effects! I wouldn’t be without it.
briehoffman,2022-01-18 19:55:12-07:00,1,0,You have to pay for everything!,The app is free but almost nothing is unlocked without paying $70. Nothing like it use to be sadly.

djdjjcdnndncjf,2022-01-18 19:40:45-07:00,1,0,It would be nice if I could use it,I mean it would be great if you could use it for free a little the only thing you can use is one ten minute meditation thing and that’s all I could find and every thing you could the you need to pay $70 to do this and u only get seven days to use it free like dude cmon I’m 15 I can’t afford $70 a year I got school and obviously don’t have a job I’m just saying I think it would be great if they made it a little more usable and budget friendly that’s all.

My only issue is that you have to pay for multiple podcasts and etc. why should we have to pay for peace and meditation when you’ve made ads that convinced you were a free app with free content."
mobish,2022-01-17 23:36:16-07:00,1,0,First try,How can the app be free when you have to pay just to try it? It is impossible to use w/o providing your credit card info. If it’s a free trial then make it free. It’s the principal. Very disappointed.

I also don’t like where you moved the Sleep tab either. 
Work on the layout-it is the best meditation app out there, but the new layout is upsetting, not calming. 
Thank you…"
Miya6,2022-01-17 20:47:56-07:00,3,0,Startling Me,"I hope I can explain this well. And hoping someone out there has a suggestion. 
I’ve been using Calm off and on for a month now. I paid for the yearly subscription. I believe it can help me learn to meditate better, center myself and fall asleep faster. 
However; when I do the daily meditations with Tara , there are long periods of her not talking and just water running in the background. But then she starts talking again and I am so startled, that it takes a while to get my heart to stop racing. I actually just end up turning off the app at that point.  Not good for anxiety. 
I have had the same issue with the sleep stories. I am falling asleep or dozing off and the voice will scare me back awake. I think some of its due to headphone and the noise/voices being right in my ear. 
Does this happen to anyone else? Have you found success by sticking to a certain theme within the app or a certain narrator? 
Thank you!"
Best and worst apps ever,2022-01-17 20:20:13-07:00,5,0,It helps me sleep,When i didn't know about the calm app I couldn't sleep but when i found out about it I slept so long you should try it to!

I’m not sure how this will do during those more intense times, BUT the sleep stories have knocked me out twice now and that is a MIRACLE. I love the celebrity stories and how well they tell them. I’ve always been one to hyper focus on my thoughts or get lost in my day dreams or an annoying sounds so I never thought a sleep story would work, but I realized when I started to fall asleep during a lecture (while I was in my bed) that if I try to focus on something kinda boring I might be able to pass out 😂 helps my mind not hyper focus! I’m still in the 7 day free trial so it doesn’t hurt to try!!"

is anything availanle,2022-01-11 05:08:57-07:00,1,0,Not free,I began using this app several years ago and liked it because it offered several free programs within each category like the confidence series but over the last year they have all disappeared. Although it was limited it was helping me manage my stress.  But There is no longer any free programs.  I liked the few they used to offer but I can’t afford to pay for the premium service which is now the entire apps programs.  So don’t be misled by the description. You need a premium account to access all the programs.  It’s hard because I lost my job due to covid and my new job pays so much less I can’t pay the bills I have.  So looking for a new free app.
E11e89,2022-01-11 04:03:49-07:00,1,0,Too chatty,I’ve used other meditation apps in the past—but decided to give this a try. The selection that they have for free isnt a true depiction of the app so I decided to pay for the subscription. This will be my first and last year using the app. The moderators are too chatty. You can select a 25 min meditation for deep concentration and they are talking for the bulk of the meditation. How can one concentrate if the moderator keeps breaking concentration by talking. This is probably a bit odd but if you’ve used other apps you’ll understand—the voices on this app arent soothing but rather abrasive in my opinion. I think the glitz and glam of this app is the fact that they have celebs on the app like Lebron—but you can get what you need from an app that doesn’t require a subscription or one that doesnt have a hefty price tag.

R1NAM1N,2022-01-10 06:09:59-07:00,5,0,I use CALM everyday,"The four apps in my dock on iPhone are Spotify, google maps, safari, and CALM. This is how essential this app has become to my overall wellbeing. 

3 years ago I started baking, which required changing my circadium rhythm of when I go  to sleep from midnight to 7pm. I developed anxiety about getting enough rest and turned to the internet for soothing routines. This is where I started an ASMR ritual before bed, eventually transitioning to distance reiki to calm my mind for sleep. I would consider youtube the free version of CALM.  Considering the ads that interupt, the imminent distractions, and the greedy curation of the app’s algorithm…. Calm is worth every penny. 

My aunt got me a CALM membership for a birthday or holiday almost 2 years ago and it has evolved so much in that time. The app saved my sleep sanity from that time I had 2 roommates & 3 dogs with a baking job where I would blast the white noise on my speaker to drown out the chaos. To now, adoring the work flow music that makes working from home, reading, and doing research much easier.

The greatest gift this app has given is the Daily Calm. They’ve now added Daily Trip too which is similarly fantastic. Meditation is humanity’s greatest tool, and as we partner with technology, CALM is an essential facet to keeping our sanity with the inevitable inseparation from our devices. 

I love the white noise related to wind & rain (wind in pines!!!!! Bamboo forest! Public museum is also a hit), the sleep stories (harry styles, asmr whisperer, etc) the music (michael denny, toro y moi). 

It’s interesting to watch how the app changes every few months, and I’m looking forward to the next update. The current layout is quite silly and confusing. 

Grateful for the free year trial Kaiser has given Americans!"

Nano_bird,2022-01-09 22:51:51-07:00,1,2,Exploitative,"This app has every potential to help people and their mental health. It’s obvious however that it has just been designed by another entrepreneur with the intention of getting rich. I find it shocking that the FIRST thing it tries to get you to do once you’ve finished a meditation is to share a quote to social media. This is encouraging the exact kind of behaviour that meditation is trying to relieve you from. It also does so under the heading “think about how it feels to check in with yourself”. I find it incredibly exploitative that after meditation, you are directed to “check in with yourself” by sharing a quote to social media. Clearly the app’s primary intention is to grow wealth for the owner. This should be the very last option someone sees, with mood diary, helpful links, etc coming first."

After 32 consecutive days of meditating, I am literally shocked at the difference in clarity and focus I’m experiencing. I am getting much more accomplished every day and I’m able to relax more and feel less overwhelmed by life as I’m living it much more in the moment. I’ve been searching for solutions to “life’s puzzle” as far back as I can remember and I think I may have finally found the answer. This is exciting!"

I’d say there are about 6 things open for meditation, stress, sleep, etc. and they will show you everything that is locked so it’s tempting to pay for it."

GingyMarie,2022-01-03 20:25:43-07:00,1,0,Trash,I trialed a few different sleep apps to help me fall asleep a few months ago and tonight I thought this app was the one that I absolutely loved so i decided to bite the bullet and subscribe to it.. Oh how wrong I was. It’s terrible. The voices they have doing the meditations to sleep are like nails on a chalkboard and it actually increased my anxiety. So here I am.. an hour and half later after trying several different medications worse off than i was before i subscribed to the app. Hopefully apple will refund me for it.

Bri_The_Second,2022-01-03 19:51:12-07:00,2,0,The sleep stories lack diversity,"This app is useful, but it would be nice to hear sleep stories written by professional Black authors like Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, and Toni Morrison rather than only LeBron James.  No offense, but if the people behind this app can add passages from literary greats like Kate Chopin, Jane Austin, and William Shakespeare, then they can add more diversity by saving space for excerpts from Black & Brown best selling authors too."

I usually listen to podcasts of the story telling variety to fall asleep.  I thought I’d give this a shot - now I’m out $74.43.  You get sucked into a subscription there is, of course, no notification to cancel when the trial is nearly up.  There is plenty of content it’s jus not good.  Like not at all.  Very disappointed with the content and the “swindley” way the subscription worked.  There is nothing I find calming or soothing about this - if anything they talk so slow and with so many adjectives it’s irritating and hard to stay in the moment of a story."

Bobalinka,2022-01-02 13:34:06-07:00,2,0,Disappointed,"I have problems sleeping. Decided to try this app and see if it helped. If it did I was going to purchase the premium membership. Unfortunately when I opened the app I could not find anything without a lock on it telling me I had to buy the membership. Now I do buy memberships to photo, calendars, games for my granddaughter etc but every app I’ve bought into gave me a basic version  to try out. After spending 15 minutes trying to find something I could try out to see if I wanted to buy in, I got aggravated and deleted the app."

Ps 1 star you will see what I am talking about it’s just a big wast of time

I got Calm because I thought it would “calm” me. When I started using it, I could barely find anything that doesn’t use premium. The Collections I want to use, I can’t, because they’re PREMIUM!  I don’t have the money to pay for an app like this and I’m sure other people can relate. 

What I’m saying is - MAKE MORE THINGS AVAILABLE FOR FREE IN THE APP!  It would really benefit stressed people like me who can’t afford premium."

I’ve tried many apps to help with my anxiety disorder, stress, self-esteem difficulties, and multiple other areas I have trouble improving alone in my life. Calm App is THE APP FOR ALL OF MY IMPROVEMENT AREAS! I love the short, simple podcasts, because I’m able to listen along on my drive to work, and/or during a stressful, anxious, or negative situation. I’m able to listen to these podcasts and after 10-12 minutes, I feel the most peaceful so I’m able to return to my previous environment with a positive, peaceful, and helpful attitude and mindset.

Jade Rose 🙃,2021-12-29 19:47:48-07:00,1,1,Too expensive,If monthly payments were an option for like $3 a month - this would be worth it. But having to pay $70 for a whole year up front is ridiculous. It claims to be a free app but everything is locked so you have to subscribe for it.
Kimmi624,2021-12-29 17:53:21-07:00,3,0,Doesn’t work as well as it should for the money,"I paid $70 for this thing, and the sleep feature does not work correctly for me at all! I set it for three hours usually, because I like the noise to continue until I know for sure that I have fallen asleep. It never fails that once it stops, it jars me out of sleep, assuming I have fallen asleep quickly enough. Unfortunately that’s exactly what keeps happening to me. I use this app on my iPad, and usually after the first song, if I am listening to sleep music, it completely stops playing, and then I get a message telling me that my timer ran out. Even though the timer underneath clearly shows that I have close to three hours still left on it. This literally happens almost every night so I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t even try to fall asleep until at least two songs have played. I like the app otherwise, but it’s absolutely ridiculous that I have to do that after having spent so much money on this thing!! 

I like the sleep stories as well, but I wish there was some way to set them on repeat because I don’t always fall asleep quickly enough and I wouldn’t mind having them play multiple times."

On the newest update, I don’t love how I have to scroll all the way to the very bottom of the sleep stories tab to see “all stories”. This is also the only place that shows the newest stories. This needs to be at the very top of the page!

This app is wonderful and I recommend it to everyone! I look forward to hearing my sleep story each night. I have my favorites for sure.
Two small suggestions: Please please please make the app Amazon Echo/Alexa compatible. I would be so happy to be able to play my sleep stories through my Echo and not my phone. Also, more Greek/Roman mythology stories would be great!"

For some reason, not all of the mediation series will keep track of where you’re at in the series, only the ones authored by Tamera (not saying anything against her but this is such a pointless drop in app design). Also, ALL of the meditations have the same flow format (ie, starts with a message, meditate for two minutes, ends with message), which gets corny and old. It’s time to put some actual GUIDED meditations back on the app where the narrators are just there to guide NOT to LEAD."

I actively avoid anything voiced by Tamara levitt due to the sound of her voice (although she is a genius and I think she is great, I can’t stand her voice for the purpose of meditation). Thank you for adding more new stories and meditations. I don’t use the music much. I like the simplicity of the app. Wish it was easier to track new releases and videos I want to check out."
Kibach5,2021-12-23 02:39:29-07:00,3,0,More Jeff Warren & Sleep Meditations!,I bought this app thinking there would be more 25+ min. soothing male voices narrating the different sleep meditations. The sleep category is dominated by the feminine voice. Could an option of Jeff Warren’s voice also record what the female voice recordings offer in the sleep section?

I do wish it wasn’t so expensive to use so I’m thinking of getting the lifetime subscription option. I really don’t have extra money but it helps me sleep and helps me to take breaks. The features on it are always a joy to explore. I LOVE the sleep songs that are deconstructed from popular songs. And of course soundscapes and sleep stories, and there’s more as well.

Dr Maa,2021-12-18 06:51:00-07:00,1,0,Unethical !!! Scam,"Signed up for “free “trial. Although they made it difficult, I cancelled.  They charged me for the entire next year anyway  !    Would expect refund any of my money.  This is a typical scam"
Qw12th,2021-12-18 03:06:38-07:00,4,0,Canceled subscription because of Tamara Levitt’s voice,"This is a great overall app. The stories for kids are amazing, the breathing techniques are great, etc. all the good things you have read from all of the other reviews. 

One of the reasons I download the app was to combat insomnia. I wake up in the middle of the night and find the sleep meditations helpful for drifting back to sleep. This got frustrating quickly because the voice of the narrator for 90% of the sleep meditations is wildly irritating. She sounds like a caricature of a dame from the 40’s. Her voice is fine if I’m not trying to fall asleep, but it is terrible at 3 in the morning. There’s no option to filter out specific narrators and she seems to be the primary voice for sleep. 

I know that sounds, including voices, land differently for everyone, so you may find her voice soothing, or at least not mind it. I am hoping that new narrators and other options are added under sleep meditations."
hahaitsdrew,2021-12-18 01:17:10-07:00,1,0,Make this stuff free,As someone who is genuinely trying to feel more comfortable with themselves and explore mental health options and self development. I find that making people pay $70 to listen to stories is unethical. If you actually wanted people to feel “calm” you’d support them by not robbing them and their wallets.

bitty the gymnast,2021-12-17 13:33:55-07:00,5,0,It is definitely worth the money to unlock all the stories!,"This app has helped me through so much, I struggle with severe anxiety and I first discovered this app while on a trip…I was really anxious and I didn’t get any sleep the last 2 nights. I already had this app on my phone but I didn’t have the premium subscription so I had very limited options, I decided to do the free trial to the premium subscription and I fell in love with it, so I decided to spend the money because it was worth it! I have been using it for a year now and I can’t tell you how much this has helped me! Before I downloaded/started using this app,  I had weeks where I only slept 2 out of the 7 nights which can take a huge impact on your mental health but ever since I have been using this app that doesn’t happen anymore, this app is a dream to own!

Now as is the case for many; I was quite skeptical on the whole “telling stories” concept. And I still am. The free background sounds that are given are quite nice, and you can use them with your phone off. But I would recommend adding a few stories for free so we know what we are going to pay 60$ a year for, so I will be able to have the confidence to invest in this app."

UPDATE THESE PLEASE: 
What would be great to have in the app in the future:
1. More low deep voices, that way it will faster to calm my anxiety. It’s a bit harder with Tamara, her voice is beautiful but it’s high note. 
2. Sleep hypnosis would be amazing to have, even with this app I always find myself going to YouTube for sleep hypnosis to fall asleep (on YouTube I always listen to slow talk with very low note voice and deep music on a background) my favorites. 
3. Would be also nice if there would be more of that French whisperer in the app, and with deep level music at a background would be fantastic. Please make some of those. 
4. Singing bowl music would be nice to have too. 

Otherwise fantastic app!!!"

WhitMoGo,2021-12-12 05:52:20-07:00,4,0,"Love the app, wish I could stack tracks","I absolutely love the content on this ap.  The only thing I think could be better is an option for making playlists or stacking of tracks.  One of my favorite features on the app is the sleep stories.  This issue is that I regularly wake up because the sleep story is over and have to fumble with my phone to turn on the next one, or go to a soundscape.  An option somewhere to string together content would solve this problem for me.  The best would be in there was also a fade in fade out option on the tracks so the beginnings and endings aren’t so abrupt.  Can you tell I struggle with sleep?! 😂 Thanks for a great app, I do use it everyday ❤️❤️"

Sleeping Bed of Roses,2021-12-11 17:50:36-07:00,5,0,Love Sleep Stories,I love this app! I had a very stressful finals week coming up but this app really helped me calm down and get good sleep. I especially loved listening to “Grounded with ROSÉ” her voice is just so soothing and beautiful.
S. L....,2021-12-11 09:11:16-07:00,1,0,Charged me with any notifications!,I downloaded the app and realized days later that my credit card was charged $69.99!
totslovescalm,2021-12-11 08:50:02-07:00,5,0,Excellent app!,"I’ve been using Calm for over a year now and it helped me tremendously during the pandemic. I love that the daily meditations are short and inspiring, soothing voices of the narrators/teachers. I’ve started listening to the night time books but always fall asleep (which means they work!). I also like the feature to set your own meditation time with nature sounds, sometimes I do need a longer session. Although I am not a 100% regular meditator, it’s always easy to come back to it. Music for work works great as well, it doesn’t seem overpowering or distracting but adds some dynamic to my work-from-home life. Thank you, Calm! ❤️"
cshine66,2021-12-11 06:48:32-07:00,5,0,Great to learn,"I have been using this app for about a year now.  
Great for learning how to meditate.   I have made a practice to do this every morning sitting in bed before work.  It is 10 minutes of my time to care for myself.  💕"
SimplyBelieve,2021-12-11 06:11:20-07:00,5,0,A worthy investment,I have enjoyed using the Calm App. So many different features available for the beginner and experienced person.
semiofthecolon,2021-12-11 01:33:51-07:00,4,0,"Great app, but what about the people who can’t afford subscription?","So I got the app. Most of the stories and songs need a subscription. I’m a minor, and don’t have that kind of money. For the people who do, great, but I really just want to sleep well for once. Maybe try adding more, instead of Tamara Levitt? 😅
I really don’t want to sound like a douche, but I’m kinda disappointed, ngl. Maybe for others, but not rlly for me😅."
Yelliekins78,2021-12-11 00:54:10-07:00,4,0,In App Volume,This app would transcend every other app if they only had in app volume. I need to keep my volume for my alarm all the way up yet am unable to listen to my beloved sleep stories because the volume would be too high to sleep to and too low to wake to if I lowered it. Please consider an in app volume feature.
KKH68,2021-12-10 18:13:03-07:00,3,0,Terrible update,I absolutely loved this app however the most recent update has made it extremely difficult to navigate now. If you can find what you are looking for the app works great.
beachbucks,2021-12-10 14:21:24-07:00,1,0,No Commie James!,I would GLADLY buy this app if you had ANYONE else pushing it on TV OTHER THAN LEBRON JAMES!!! GET WOKE………GO BROKE!!!

christieg4,2021-12-10 10:17:01-07:00,5,0,Where has this been all my life?!,"I’ve battled anxiety & depression for over 30 yrs. I’ve been to doctors, therapists, read books, listened to self help cd’s, tried several medications and done procedures such as biofeedback. Nothing has calmed me as quickly as this app!!! I heard about it watching Netflix “explained” series, the episode on mindfulness. I’ve only done 2 sessions and I’m just amazed how quickly it works! Wonderful!!! My only complaint is it’s taken me so long to discover!"

But there aren’t enough Asmr 
The sleep stories are top notch. 
shishi’s story had helped me sleep and relax for a a very long time."
Lilis2018,2021-12-09 22:43:50-07:00,1,0,No free content,There is nothing on the app that is free. No free content to view.
Swamiking,2021-12-09 20:33:19-07:00,4,0,Wrong message.,"Having Lebron on the app is inappropriate due to his support for China and their oppression and persecution on Uyghurs. Please reconsider his involvement.

StreetSpirit666,2021-12-09 14:02:39-07:00,1,0,Everything behind a pay wall,"This app didn’t use to be like this. There were simple free contents and paid contents, something for everyone. But now everything is lucked behind a pay wall. Even simple soundscapes like fire or thunderstorm soundscapes are not accessible. I am very disappointed but it’s the developer’s choice. Just as it’s my choice to delete this app and never install or recommend it again."

GatorGuyNTampa,2021-12-08 17:46:50-07:00,5,0,Relaxing is the new norm with the Calm app,I love this app. The calm app lets me relax to the point of falling asleep quickly.

AnthoNYC_,2021-12-08 16:31:45-07:00,1,0,What a con.,This is hands down the most misleading and disappointing app I’ve ever downloaded.    The app markets these amazing visuals with stunning graphics.  But once installed there is none of that.   I’m not paying $70/yr to listen to people talk when i need sleep.

JAMEZ LAFLAME,2021-12-08 07:27:18-07:00,5,0,Calm App Review,This App Has Changed My Life. It’s Worth Every Cent For The Premium.
Bowhunter:),2021-12-08 05:35:02-07:00,2,0,What happened to free,I used to use this app all the time. Once it updated it got rid of all my saved sounds and everything is locked. I used soundscapes a lot and although not many were unlocked there was still a small variety to choose from. Since the update NONE of the soundscapes are unlocked and hardly any other sound to help with sleep is either. Will be downloading another app for sure

I have fallen asleep very soundly before hearing the ending of the story each time!

John's Bee,2021-12-07 02:45:55-07:00,5,0,Morning Calm,"I lost my husband suddenly last year. Mornings were the worst part of my day for months & months. I found the music on the Calm app helped soothe & settle my racing thoughts & emotions. I wasn’t sleeping well so I always woke very early, I would sit on my deck with a cup of coffee & stare out at the fields & empty my mind of everything but the soothing music & beautiful scenery. Thank you Calm for helping me through the hardest year of my life! I have used this music on long flights & middle of the night worry sessions to help me find a bit of serenity."
2DF1980,2021-12-06 20:33:20-07:00,2,0,Old Content,Calm needs some new sleep content. Not from lame celebrities like LeBron James.  I’ve used this app for over 18 months and it’s getting old and tired…..

After initially loving the app for ONE personality I go today to check on my charges and find something like 30 CHARGES that are all different, AFTER I had already purchased for a year. This is such a scam!! Makes me so freaking angry. And before anyone tells me it was for per month, no. The highest amount was a $95.99 and the lowest was $14.99. And I only had it since April. Absolutely illegal and negligent app company. Livid."

Holisticmama,2021-12-05 06:18:19-07:00,2,0,Lack of meditations,"About 95% of the meditations have the same host (Tamara Levitt). Sometimes people prefer different voices, so the lack of variety here is astounding given that this app is huge. Don’t purchase this app for the meditations the best part of it is just the sleep stories and soundscapes."
