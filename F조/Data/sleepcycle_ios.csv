Rambler T,2022-01-19 10:18:09-07:00,1,0,Now Broken - No Longer Working,"I've used this for years as my sleep tracker and alarm.  Within the past few weeks, Sleep Cycle won't even make it through the night.  Looking back at each log, it seems to run for about 4-5 hours, then just shuts itself down.  Yes, I've restarted my phone (do this about once a week anyway).  Just no longer works with the latest updates.  iPhone X running iOS 15.2.  Please fix or I'm going to need to explore other options."
Dibbus1987,2022-01-19 09:50:44-07:00,4,0,Works great mostly,"The only things that I wish it could improve on are 1. It’s so sensitive that it’s picking up all of my husband’s snoring and even him talking on the phone in another room, which throws my sleep accuracy off, and 2. Sometimes I forget to stop it on the morning and I’d like to be able to edit the time I got up. Otherwise it thinks I go back to sleep if I put down the phone and it throws all the data for the whole night."
The Gay™️,2022-01-18 23:39:55-07:00,1,0,Tried 7 day free trial and immediately charged for premium,I wanted to give the free trial a try to see if premium was worth it and immediately im charged for premium. I’m extremely not happy about this at all! Now I have to try and get my money back!
Kim Bullion,2022-01-18 21:52:29-07:00,2,0,Not working well,"The app hasn’t been picking much up, so I’m not getting any data. I turned my air purifier off to see if that would help. Since I didn’t have the whit noise of the purifier, I tried the forest pond and creek, etc. But they disturbed my sleep. I’m not sure why animals rustling in the underbrush in jarring sequences or someone’s footsteps walking by while you are trying to fall asleep were added. As a backpacker those sounds put you on high alert. Nobody wants a mouse chewing through their gear or hearing footsteps walking by your tent all night. 😂 Is Then you really can’t sleep and end up writing this review."
Savannah Pless,2022-01-18 19:58:45-07:00,4,0,Have used for YEARS,"I personally love this app and recommend it to anyone. Especially someone that hates being jolted awake with loud tones or wants to be woken up when they’re the most “awake”. Overall, a great app for tracking how good your sleep is BUT I am disappointed in a new feature I noticed. I went to go to sleep tonight and went to play my podcasts that help me sleep (I listen to two specific podcasts on the apple podcast app) however, when I played the podcast with a sleep timer set, the sleep cycle app kept turning the podcast off because “it couldn’t access the microphone.” I would prefer if this feature only gave the warning while still allowing the sound to play until it inevitably turns off. This would allow for me to fall asleep to what I’m used to while also tracking my sleep after my podcast cuts off. I hope you take this into consideration because otherwise I may have to go back to loud apple alarm tones just so I can fall asleep the night before 😞"
FrankP2491,2022-01-18 04:45:12-07:00,3,0,Great app weird move to subscription though,"I love this app I purchased it back in September of 2011! This app is great as someone who is for all intensive purposes a bad sleeper this app is amazing. I can’t fall asleep at night and have a hard time waking up. This app seems to always start ringing when i’m kinda in that in between sleep and awake phase in the morning even if it is 15 min earlier than I want sometimes lol! But it’s right on every time 

I used it since 2011 so the app itself is really good. But I give it 3 stars because now when I open the app it says I should upgrade to a subscription service when I paid for this app years ago. I even still have the order confirmation #! 

A lot of apps have been doing this lately and it’s a very bad business practice. If app developers can’t be trusted to do the right thing by their customers then apple needs to step in and guarantee purchases."
Of.coochiescouter,2022-01-18 04:26:00-07:00,2,0,Premium,why do I have to pay for premium to do anything I had this app about maybe a year or two ago worked great listening to the audio was very much needed. I downloaded again last night and i can't do anything without paying I refuse to pay that much and really all i'm looking is to track my sleep and audio at the very least that should be free!
cosmicchaotic,2022-01-17 21:28:03-07:00,3,0,Watch App Needs Work…,"I’ve used this app on my phone for years now and I’ve always been very satisfied with it. 

That being said, I recently got an Apple Watch, and the Sleep Cycle watch app leaves some things to be desired. It crashes on launch about 50% of the time. When it doesn’t crash, it often insists that I need to open the app on my phone when I try to start my alarm (it gives this message even when I /DO/ have the phone app open, whether the phone app’s alarm/analysis is active or not). I’ve tried restarting my device, uninstalling/reinstalling the app on my watch, and my memory is only 20.5% full, so I don’t think it’s an issue on my device’s end. 

In addition, I also think the watch app would benefit from having the “no alarm” analysis mode easily available."
Dianadiluxe,2022-01-17 06:32:40-07:00,1,0,No longer working,"I have used this app for years, but ever since the last update it mysteriously shuts down in the middle of the night, saying I got one or two horse of sleep.Because of this I’ve overslept twice. I no longer trust it."
Cwtech,2022-01-16 19:45:01-07:00,4,0,Sleep aid default changing,Please please please STOP changing my default sleep aid from the ONLY one worth using. Celestial creek! I don’t want environmental and defiantly not someone taking!
Rufusion,2022-01-16 17:33:19-07:00,4,0,Need more “night” sounds!,"This is a great app. I like all its features and it works as advertised. I’ve literally been using it for years, and it’s gotten me through some times where anxiety might have otherwise kept me awake much longer. My one gripe is that all the nature-type ambient sounds are daytime sounds! Let’s get some crickets, frogs, hoot owls, coyotes… things that make my brain say, it’s sleepytime!"
camdenM1561,2022-01-16 15:32:48-07:00,4,0,.,"this app is really helping me to recognize my bad sleeping habits! i wake up several times a sleep, and i’m usually sleeping during the day. 

because i’m asleep during the day, the app picks up noises of everyone else in the house. this isn’t too much of a problem, though. 

i’d love the option to not have an alarm. i don’t have any schedule or anywhere i need to be, so setting an alarm is a bit annoying. at this point i just set the alarm for the latest time so it doesn’t alert me because i’m already awake.

i’m not sure how this app tracks the deepness of your sleep but i assume it’s breathing patterns. (rem sleep and being awake have different patterns.) but those breathing patterns change on your age, so an option to input age to increase accuracy would be nice. (assuming that’s how the app tracks sleep deepness.)"
mrs iq,2022-01-16 07:09:40-07:00,1,0,Recent updates not working…,I have used this app for YEARS. I’m talking like almost 10 years probably. The last few months the updates have been really malfunctioning. I set the alarm as I have been and every morning I open my phone and the app has just stopped working. Luckily I have a three year old that wakes me up otherwise I would have been late to work several days out of the last two months.
tom21dotcom,2022-01-16 03:58:56-07:00,3,0,Changed horses in mid stream?,"I have been a very happy customer( 5 stars) for about 10 years until a couple weeks ago. It appears the developers have changed the algorithms such that the same sleep patterns recorded for years suddenly result in substantially decreased quality ratings, thus making the statistics questionable. 
Very unsatisfactory bordering on arbitrary and capricious.
Thanks for all the years before 2022 , but I’m not able to trust your results anymore."
thegolub,2022-01-15 18:54:39-07:00,1,0,Useless for insomnia  - worst Apple effort ever,"This app is so frustrating! Every time I use it, it says I fall asleep after ten or fifteen minutes, when I’ve been lying awake for hours trying to sleep. I hoped it might help me with my insomnia, but it clearly has no idea whether I’m sound asleep or lying awake wishing I could be sleeping! Possibly Apple’s worst app, and I have used Mac products faithfully since 1986! I had such high expectations for this but it’s ridiculously inaccurate. IF THIS IS A BUG, PLEASE FIX IT.
I would really feel bad if I paid money for it."
PiEquals3,2022-01-15 10:12:21-07:00,2,0,Only works in a quiet room,"This app uses your microphone to listen to you sleep all night. However if your room, like mine, is very loud then it will pick up all the other noise and say you didn’t sleep at all. Seems like a cool idea, but does not always work. I wish it would allow you to disable the microphone and just have inaccurate results, or in my case results that were slightly more accurate."
constant the man,2022-01-14 22:06:41-07:00,5,0,Genius App,"This tells me exactly when I fall asleep, when I am snoring or talking to myself, and rates the quality of my sleep. at the start of every morning I see an entire review of my night! Family member suggested this application it's totally free and it is the most amazing thing"
Milady717,2022-01-14 04:30:37-07:00,1,0,Stopped working,Loved this app but for some reason it just stopped recording/saving. It looks like it’s working but there is 0 data.
DoGoodDreamscape,2022-01-13 20:28:51-07:00,4,0,Watch integration please.,"I wish the watch part of this worked with the phone part of it so that I could snooze from my watch. 
Or even better, it could also use movement info from the watch to track sleep. 
I’ll be happy with just the ability to snooze. 
For now, the watch part of the app is completely separate it appears."
s050m3,2022-01-13 18:50:56-07:00,2,0,The fact that it can track me as both awake and snoring at the same time is all you need to know,"Been using it for about 6-8 weeks and had doubts about those long-ish awake times I didn’t remember . Not an in-depth or comparative review , just an obvious incoherence between the data and reality so far . Deleted it"
Margaret Bear,2022-01-13 13:01:43-07:00,4,0,Trouble with Sleep Aids,"I love this app!  I can easily see my habits and trends. However, the sleep guides turn off after about 15 minutes, even after the updated version."
1234589Elena,2022-01-13 09:03:08-07:00,1,0,Wrong,It doesn’t really track my sleep. I got some random data at the end of night.
vividescapist,2022-01-13 08:45:47-07:00,5,0,Still love it after 5.5 years,"I have used this app for 5.5 years now, putting it on almost every night, and I love it. The data is so useful to me. I look back at my report from the previous night every day and since I use it consistantly I can see and interpret trends. E.g. because of this app I know that I recently started snoring, and am going to discuss it with my doctor. I think the interface is pretty easy to navigate and I can quickly pull up data from any night in the past using the calendar. The app looks nice aesthetically, and shows information clearly.

It is very effective at tracking your sleep cycles throughout the night and picking up your own sleep sounds (snoring and talking etc) without background noise affecting it very often. I appreciate that it differentiates between night sleep and a nap based on how long you slept. The low battery alert (will play an alarm if your phone is about to die no matter what time) is one of my favorite features as it gives me peace of mind that I will never miss my alarm if I forget to plug my phone in.

This is an app that you can truly have a good experience without paying for premium, but if you do want to upgrade, there is some nice additions for a decent price. I upgraded in the past but I guess when they changed the app I no longer had access to everything? They grandfathered me in though so I have like half of the premium features, and I am content with that.

Would definitely reccomend trying this app out if you have any interest in tracking your health or improving your sleep. Give it a couple weeks of consistent use so you can see what the utility is."
prl1123,2022-01-12 22:16:30-07:00,2,0,It crashes,The app doesn’t record my sleep or wake me up with the alarm at least every other night. It was reliable for the last couple years but has not worked properly for the last few months. I simply can not depend on it anymore and will look for a more reliable app
fernanda.g2022,2022-01-12 20:01:21-07:00,4,0,Great App,"I love that this app can help track my sleep. Using this app has actually given me the motivation to sleep earlier and sleep more because I realize how little i’m actually sleeping. The only thing I would complain about is the fact that all the good things are premium. I get that the app has to have some good things in the premium section but I think it’s too much. Other than that, the app is great!"

After many years, they decided you must signup
Goodbye"
Slvrdragon41,2022-01-12 10:29:33-07:00,1,0,Updates Broke this app.  I plan to discontinue payments for Pro,"App worked brilliantly for first 1-1/2 years after purchase.  Recent updates have caused failure to send data to phone, crashing in the middle of the night.  Currently I’m using it as a glorified alarm, and I can use anything FREE for that.  Looking for new sleep monitoring app."
Htcsr,2022-01-12 07:22:22-07:00,2,0,"Awake, not asleep","The sleep tracker notes that I am asleep, in a deep sleep, when I’m actually awake and reading. I have insomnia, and wake up between 1-4:00, staying awake for 3+ hours. Also, the tracker notes that I’m snoring for a few minutes every night at invervals, but I had my iPad recording any sounds, and there was no sound at all of snoring. Coughing yes. iPad 8 inches away from my face. My iPhone is further away, 12-15”"
AlwaysDreaming999,2022-01-12 04:21:06-07:00,1,0,Used to be the best,This app used to be my absolute favorite. I don’t know what’s happened but it is completely unreliable at this point. It is constantly force closing part way through the night. Any time I try to use it I have to have backup alarms set because most of the time this app won’t still be running for the alarm to go off in the morning. Truly disappointing because I actually used it to track how well I was sleeping.
Better Rested in NH,2022-01-12 03:33:06-07:00,4,0,Has helped me keep a more consistent sleep schedule,"I really like the journal- showing me how long I have been in bed, how long asleep.   Sometimes it thinks I am coughing when it is my wife - but other than that it has been good and I have found it useful."
Pronoia Rose,2022-01-12 02:27:11-07:00,1,0,SOS,"Used to rave about this app so it hurts to write this but plain and simple, it doesn’t even work properly as a simple alarm any longer, let alone track accurate data. It shuts off and stops working randomly about 50% of the time. I tried uninstalling, soft phone reset, shutting down all other apps, signing out and back in, confirming all updates have been made, you name it I’ve tried to fix it from my end and nothing has helped. I’m hoping there’s time to save the ship from drowning altogether but for now, I have to find a new app."
Jhearom,2022-01-11 06:09:47-07:00,1,0,App crashing recently,"I’ve used this app for years and it was incredible. However it has been crashing overnight lately (and the last 4 work nights in a row!), which is a nonstarter for an app that I’d like to rely on. I’ll take the abrupt wakeup of another alarm for now. Give me a reason to believe in y’all again."
Derek4real,2022-01-11 05:13:34-07:00,2,0,Crashes when using snooze,For the 2nd time in a month I was late to work because the app crashed when using the “tap to snooze” function. Plz update and patch
thatcjkid,2022-01-10 21:56:20-07:00,1,0,Account expired???,"I have had this app for probably a decade. It's always been on each phone I get. I was logged out and forgot my password of course, because I made and bought this app so many years ago. 

I reset my password and now it won't let me log in and says the account is expired. That is absolutely ridiculous."
GirthyHCock,2022-01-10 15:43:00-07:00,3,0,When it works it’s great but randomly stops working way too often,"Does help you feel less drowsy when waking up, but a quarter of the time the alarm just shuts off for no apparent reason"
abbyhun,2022-01-10 06:42:19-07:00,5,0,OMG… I snore!,"I never knew I snored and this app shocked the bajeesus out of me when I heard myself on the recording. That information was super beneficial to me. 

I’m giving the app 5 stars because it makes me excited to log my sleep and I have valuable insights from it. That being said, There are still some bugs in the app that I hope are worked Thru … there have been several nights that I don’t feel the data has been accurate as far as time gone to sleep and awake hours compared to the hours I’ve actually been asleep. It also doesn’t merge the data in a 24 hour cycle to show total hours slept ex: I go to sleep at 12 midnight….Wake up at 1 am …stop the app and get up because I am not going to lay in bed tossing … start the app again when I go back to bed at 3 am and wake up at 10am… and then maybe I have a nap in the afternoon,  the data shows I had a 1 hour night and a 7 hour night and another 1 hour sleep… not 8 or 9 hours of sleep in that 24 hour cycle. I wish there was a way to merge all the sleep in a 24 hour cycle so I could see hours slept in a day. Maybe there’s a way to do that and I haven’t found it. 
Overall though I am enjoying the assistance this is giving me to regulate my sleep hours.  Just knowing the app is on will make me not pick up my phone in the middle of the night for “screen time” etc, it makes me think about honoring a sleep cycle. Also just knowing the recording is on makes me feel better knowing what’s going on while I’m asleep. So yes I would definitely recommend giving this app a try."
39473291,2022-01-09 10:54:57-07:00,3,0,eh….,It’s not that good you have to buy a premium just to hear u snore cough ect. And you can’t even see the diagram of your sleeping unless u buy a premium.  I find it unfair that some of us cant hear ourselves.
Lurvinator,2022-01-09 09:37:24-07:00,3,0,There are some nice things but other annoying things,"I used a different sleep app for years before coming to this one. The reason I stopped using my old one, sleep bot, was because the app had been taken off the App Store and when I upgraded to my latest iPhone, Apple wouldn’t let me download it since it was no longer listed. So after having used an app for the better part of 6 years, there is certainly an adjustment period to the new perks of a different app. Sleep cycle was the recommended app so I downloaded it and tried it out. At first I was impressed with it and even went out of my way to pay for premium. But since then I’ve been whelmed with what the app can do. First I’ll say what I love:

WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS APP: the wake up system. The app has three wake up modes. Two are alarms and one is with no alarm. No alarm is pretty self explanatory, just use it on a morning you don’t need to wake up. Then you have no wake up window and wake up window. No wake up window is a standard alarm that will go off at the time you select it to go off. Wake up window will begin to wake you up 30 minutes before your set wake up time. I’ve found this to be very helpful as I can be a heavy sleeper and have slept through alarms in the past. It will begin to play a soft alarm and will go off as soon as you pick up your phone. Then it will automatically go into a snooze setting getting shorter and shorter as you get closer to your set wake up time. This has helped me for sure as I’ve been able to wake up around the time I needed to.

WHAT I DO NOT LOVE ABOUT THIS APP: there’s a couple of things I don’t love about this app. Other users have reported this as well, but the app tracking your ‘actual sleep’ is inaccurate. I don’t know what causes the app to think I get less sleep than I actually do, but the app always reports I had less sleep the night before. I started Cpap therapy in June of 2021, and my Resmed has an app that tracks my sleep through the machine. The cpap can tell when I’m asleep based on my breathing patterns and it always comes out with a longer time than what the SC app does. And it’s not the difference in 10 or 20 minutes. It’s a couple of hours difference. For example: if I’m in bed for 7.5 hours, SC will say I was only asleep for 5.2 hours. My cpap will read that I was asleep for close to 7 hours. I understand the cpap has the advantage of monitoring breathing over the SC monitoring sound, but I can’t use something that’s going to be so inaccurate. 

My other complaint is the fact you cannot stack your times in bed. Let’s just say, it’s early in the morning and I get out of bed to go to the bathroom or I’ve just woken up in the morning. I wake up the app to see my time and see “oh it’s only been 6 hours, I can go back to bed” when ever you turn the app back on the go back to sleep, it begins a new entry! And a lot of the times, it won’t count that entry because it’s too short to register once you wake up after an hour. The app should have an option to check your sleep times without interrupting the app or vice versa, be able to add more sleep time to an existing day. This shouldn’t be too difficult either if the app recognizes dates starting at 12 Noon instead of 12 AM. 

Overall, this app is alright but some of the key features of the app leave a lot to be desired."

FreeTibet.,2022-01-08 09:47:01-07:00,5,0,Sleep Cycle Keeps Track of My Sleep,"This app is great to see what sleep cycle one is in during the duration of a night’s rest. Helpful tool if you want to feel better rested and have a knowledge of what stage you are in during one’s natural sleep cycle. Alarm feature is useful, too."
DocKoko,2022-01-08 03:48:36-07:00,1,0,Try premium bar gets in the way,"I understand they want me to try the premium service, but I don’t want to pay for it. Now they’ve added a bar that gets in the way of using the product. I’m about ready to stop using it. I’m certainly ready to go look for other apps that I might use instead. It’s not really that accurate anyway. A lot of times I will get up in the middle of the night and even be using my phone and the app registers that I’m still asleep."
beboo1,2022-01-07 09:15:04-07:00,5,0,Love the app but…,I have recently come a crossed where the app closes its self out when I have an alarm set!!!! Today I actually missed a meeting!  Is this a glitch?
jimmy_pop89,2022-01-07 04:33:02-07:00,1,0,Unreliable.,"End of an era. I’ve been using Sleep Cycle for years. I was one of the original premium users. It’s been a favorite app of mine forever. 

Until recently. Over the last few months, the app has just been acting strange. Hasn’t been recording sleep data like it used to, the snooze wouldn’t work right some mornings, the alarm sound would be different. Little annoying things. 

Then this week, the worst. For the second time this week, I’ve overslept because the alarm never went off. The app displays the “Good Morning” screen as if the alarm went off — but it never played any sounds.The first time it happened, I thought it was something that I did wrong, because again, I’ve been using this app for years and it’s never done that. But the second time within a few days? Yeah… no. 

So that’s it for me. An app I’ve loved for years I have totally lost trust in over just a matter of days. 

See ya around, Sleep Cycle."

QtheDOC,2022-01-06 09:08:54-07:00,4,0,Thank you for giving us the data,"I’ve loved sleep cycle for many years now and just found a way to love it even more: you can download your sleep data! These days having access and control over your own data is very important. More companies should be like this.

Ok Update, there is a lot of data here, I wish they had a cloud feature where the data didn’t need to be stored locally. The size of this app is getting out of hand on my phone."
liliumtigre,2022-01-06 03:28:05-07:00,5,0,Calming start,The first alarm I’ve ever found that truly wakes me up gently. Great way to start the day ☀️
neeci44,2022-01-06 02:52:08-07:00,5,0,I sleep Better,I like that I can hear what goes on when I’m asleep. I can hear my dogs snoring too. I hear my dogs up too. I can hear when my son gets home late. I like the clock noise it puts me to sleep right away. I like that I get to wake up slowly. I like that I can test my heart rate.
thegreatchapatu,2022-01-05 19:02:20-07:00,5,0,Fantastic app for sleep,I’m not much of a reviewer but for this app I had to put a review. First I’d like to say thank you to the devs. I have been using this app for awhile now and am thoroughly enjoying it. I love the sounds and reports I get about my sleep. I even have it linked up to my watch. If anyone is looking to understand their sleep more then check the app out and upgrading to premium is well worth the price. I would like to to be able to buy premium for others and gift it. Maybe that’ll be something in a future update. Now it’s almost bedtime so I’ll go stroll through the meadows as I drift to sleep.
Wes Kronberg,2022-01-05 06:04:56-07:00,5,0,Sleep,"I find it very interesting.

Easy does it in savannah,2022-01-05 05:22:16-07:00,2,0,Was good but now it’s not working right,I have been using this app for over a year now and never had any issues until recently. Now it just turns off at like 1am and then I have no alarm and I wake up late. I’ve had to delete it and go back to my traditional alarm which stinks but I have to have something reliable.
trying to like the Apple we,2022-01-05 02:58:07-07:00,1,0,Over priced,I accidentally downloaded the app and realized it cost 29.99. I tried cancelling immediately…”there was a problem” I want to cancel and not be charged…and they even warn you to cancel before the end of the one week trial. They don’t make it easy to cancel. Just frustrated.
ChainedRadioHost,2022-01-04 00:14:22-07:00,4,0,"App is great! I have a reoccurring issue that makes the experience a bit worse, however.","Like the title says, I’ve been having this issue recently where the sleep aid that I select as part of my paying for this premium service, the sleep aid just randomly stops on me. Not sure why. It will just cut off after a minute or two. I checked the settings, set the fade out to 90 minutes, all sorts of stuff like that- but nothing has changed.

As an entrepreneur, it helps to wake up to soft, natural tones and this intuitive app is the BEST at waking me up gently without making me feel groggy. The only suggestion I have is to include a feature where you can set an ongoing alarm or set an alarm for each day at one time in case you fall asleep early/unexpectedly and forget to set your alarm.

How I use it: wake up slowly or just monitoring. I then turn on a 35 minute timer set to “stop playing” at the end of the the timer, and turn on music. Yes, this messes up the first 35 minutes of accurate sleep tracking, but it has never affected my waking up. 

Last night was a repeat of what issues I’ve been having. I turned on the sleep timer at 11:15pm (along with the timer and music), woke up at 4am. Stayed awake for a bit playing a mindless game on my phone. This app was still running, and I didn’t turn it off. This morning, the app wasn’t running. It showed zero data from last night. 

Multiple times I’ve woken up in the morning and my alarm hasn’t gone off, the app isn’t running, and there’s no data. I would at least have expected that it would show the data from the first part of the night. 

Now I don’t feel comfortable having this as my only alarm, and I set a backup.

I deleted the app and tried to do it any and start back at the one day and record, it did NOT record anything and in Journal it said I can view it once I record…I tried to scroll down and it said recordings were Automatically being deleted! It also said I couldn’t view the statistics because I needed 5-7 days, abs I have been using it longer than that and nothing is recording or working anymore. I tried contacting them on their website rebut the form WILL NOT go through so I’m doing it on here. I can NOT get a refund from Apple even though on the site it says that I can request one.

It accurately tracks my sleep each night and with premium I can learn even more about what affects my sleep and my tendencies from night to night. Highly recommend as the premium is completely optional for anyone looking for a good sleep-tracking app.

Small edit: the only problem I have with the app is that the sleep tracking can be easily interrupted and just stop the tracking for the night completely. This mainly happens with things that take away the microphone, like a phone call. Though I understand it can’t really be helped. The only thing I wish they would add is the ability to resume sleep tracking if it is ended either by something else or you just did it accidentally"

I really am not interested in changing a critical part of my bedtime routine with completely new background sounds. 

 Also I know there’s a companion nap app but it would be helpful to tag or log separate periods of sleep so the data better reflects night time sleeping. I’ve seen on other reviews the developers response to this as suggesting napping isn’t “best” for sleep which seems like an absurd excuse-product should reflect user needs and reality. 

 Plenty more feedback if you need, those are the only two concerns that would encourage me to use a competitor app."
Machineies,2021-12-21 06:34:23-07:00,3,2,Disappointing and mediocre,"I’ve been using sleep cycle consistently for over 2 years now, and I’ve had premium for a year. I’m disappointed to say that even though I’ve always been optimistic about this app, it’s just not that good. The time in bed compared to time asleep is always inaccurate. The sleep recordings record way too much static background noise. The most annoying thing is that in the last few months the app has been crashing overnight, so you lose all of the data for that night and it ruins your sleep report. It’s gotten to the point where this app only works 3 or 4 days out of the week, it’s always really spotty and is no longer reliable. As for the premium features, there is not enough content to justify a 30 dollar price tag. Seeing your data on the graphs is nice, but they are too general and there aren’t enough tools. I want to be able to see biweekly data, compare sleep statistics between months, see different groupings of data besides what’s currently available. I would suggest sticking with the free version of the app since the data is lackluster, and the nighttime audio recordings never work well. It’s very upsetting having to write this review after using this app for so long, but it’s ridiculous. Add more content to premium or lower the price. Most importantly, stop your app from crashing."

Lykanthrope,2021-12-16 16:54:38-07:00,2,0,Farewell to Features,"I purchased the app ages ago and recent updates have removed features to put behind their subscription paywall. 

Ultimately this is a toy. It's not a sleep study, it won't provide you with better sleep, the information log on you is not life changing. The decent feature is the sound machine--which was stripped to the bare minimum that you can find almost anywhere else for a better value. Though I'm retrospect a lot of the tracks are obtrusively peaky for ambience and their samples too recognizable from the stock clips.

 Had they innovated their services to warrant an upgrade, or sold DLC, it might have been less of a problem. Instead they've chosen to sell me the app I've already purchased. It's disappointing. Do not recommend."

I like the snore tracking and am not really sure what happens once I fall asleep so I can’t really comment on that part of sleep tracking. It does well with sound capture even though I use a CPAP machine.
The one big issue I found is the amount of time it says I’m awake when I go to bed before falling asleep. I’m asleep the moment my head hits the pillow. Well almost. However, the app exaggerates the amount of time I’m awake at the start of my sleep cycle. So in total it almost always says my sleep is less than what I actually get.

SI1V3R,2021-12-13 08:32:25-07:00,4,0,Amazing app - 10 years of use thus far.,"I love this app, I’ve been using it since I got my first iPhone over ten years ago. You can set an alarm, or just let it measure sleep. There are options for smart alarms, or a specific time. The data supplied is amazing, I’ve gotten a much better sense of how long it takes me to fall asleep and what I need to do to sleep better. My only gripe is right now the app won’t open on new Apple Watch, once that is resolved I will happily change this review to 5 stars."
POedcreator,2021-12-13 04:21:17-07:00,2,0,Inaccurate sleep quality,"So the app said I was in bed for nearly 8 hours, but I was asleep for less than 6 hours. It also showed me waking up multiple times during the night, snoring, etc. It was a rough night.
But, it still gave me a “sleep quality” score of 97%? How in the world is that right? 
I’m still using it for the alarm, but I canceled my premium subscription. It’s not accurate enough to be worth paying for."

Very annoying."
mother vic,2021-12-12 06:55:47-07:00,1,0,Doesn’t save if you don’t swipe up,"There is no where that it is said to make sure to swipe up in the app when you wake up to make sure to save the sleep data. I have a habit of closing out my apps and I did that on an important day I wanted to track my sleep and now all the data is gone for that night. It makes no sense to me since the recordings should’ve already been saved. As someone who paid for the yearly subscription this was extremely frustrating to literally WAKE UP TO and now I regret even wasting my money on this. Don’t waste your money on this, it even mistakes bird chirps for baby noises."

Literal scam of an app"
Doc Halliday 7767,2021-12-11 09:05:30-07:00,3,0,Missing One major Option,"I have had the Sleep Cycle app for about a week and only have three days logged.  I have downloaded the Sleep Cycle app and like it so far. But I also have another Sleep app and am comparing the two to decide which one to keep.  So far the Sleep Cycle app is running a close second place. The main reason for this is the lack of automatic detection of me going to sleep.  The other app detects the approximate time I become motionless late in the evening. Most of the time it is spot on. Sometimes I have to edit the time which is no big deal. 
If Sleep Cycle wants to surpass the other app it needs the sleep detection function."

It has not gone off at random times the last 2 months and caused me to oversleep. What used to be a really reliable app has started to flake on me. On the nights the alarm doesnt go off, the app also doesnt record my sleep. Its as if I never set it, but I am always positive I did. I had to start setting backup alarms on my phone in case. I hope this can get fixed because I really do enjoy the app."

DJLayinLo,2021-12-08 21:17:47-07:00,4,0,Attractive app,I’ve used sleep cycle off and on for years. I don’t get premium content anymore because I’m not fond of subscription based pricing. It is a good app that is worth trying if you’re curious about your sleep quality and waking at the most optimum time. The interface is very pleasing and functional. Free is feature loaded and the premium content is cool if you’re into the extra stats.
beaubur21,2021-12-08 21:10:14-07:00,2,0,Great start but got greedy,I’ve used sleep cycle since 2012 and have never had an issue with it. But the sudden paywalls and premium pushes are crazy. Spending $30 annually on an already paid app for sounds that were free for years? Just not cool.

However, it let me down immensely recently and made me late for work, causing me a lot of stress. I traveled to a different time zone, and the wake-up time chooser’s time zone did not update. I selected to wake up at 7:30am but the alarm was actually set for 10:30am, and I was quite late. 

I’m wary about using Sleep Cycle as opposed to my iPhone alarm now."
EmilySuzanne888,2021-12-06 18:08:44-07:00,5,27,Great app!!,"I really enjoyed this app and I think that it would be extremely beneficial for anyone who wants to be more educated about their sleep patterns or for people who are having a hard time sleeping. This app tracks your sleep cycles by tracking your sleep patterns and how often you wake in your sleep, move around, snore, cough, talk, etc. In the morning you can look back and see at what points/times you awoke and you can even listen back to audio to hear what you were doing in your sleep. It also has a function to gently wake you up when you’re in a light sleep. This would be helpful for people who have insomnia or who may think they have insomnia, due to it tracking how often you awake. It could also help with people who have anxiety of sleeping or falling asleep because you can rest assured knowing that it will record you all night and that you can hear everything the moment you wake up. there’s no wondering what happened while you were asleep, because the app will show/tell you. It could also help adults and children with ADHD who have a hard to going to sleep because it has a sound function to help you relax and fall asleep and again, you can hear everything that you did when you wake up in the morning."

sexy potato godess,2021-12-06 04:58:17-07:00,3,0,Premium?,"I feel like having to pay a monthly bill to hear if you snore or not is a bit of a waste of money. I don't want any of the other features that come with premium and i feel like if you’re going to charge to use 90% of the app, you should instead put a price on the app itself rather than make people pay a monthly/yearly bill for the app’s features. I do appreciate that the price is low though."

Anyways best app ever 10/10 recommend I have never felt happy to pay for an app but this app is so worth it!!!!!
JD.0828,2021-12-05 22:16:34-07:00,4,0,Very good sleep tracker,I’ve used this app for almost 3 years now. So helpful w sleep aid & tracking. I wish they would update their sleep aids more often. I listen to the guides & stories to get to sleep & it would be nice to have more variety instead of listening to same ones. I also wish it would let you turn the volume low for the sleep aid but still be loud for the alarm in the morning.  —JD
Bittyshoo,2021-12-05 14:17:07-07:00,2,0,Not accurate at tracking sleep,"I really wanted to like this app but it is terrible at tracking when you are sleeping or awake. The other night I was wide awake and it said I was asleep. I have found it often will track me as asleep when I am awake. I feel it makes it seem like I am getting better sleep than I actually am which defeats the purposes of tracking it to improve it. I have tried it via the watch and via the phone and both are inaccurate. 

I gave it two stars because it does have nice features and reporting capabilities it’s just the data that isn’t accurate."

This happened the last two nights in a row. Fortunately, I woke up on my own shortly after the time my alarm should have sounded. It’s to the point, however, that I have to set a backup alarm, which is a huge annoyance since I love this app and paid for the upgrade. Sadly, I may need to look for a similar service that is more reliable."

I was sleeping really good and woke up at 11:30, so I slept in late. I checked my phone and listened to the recording, but what I heard was horrifyingly scary. I swear I was alone in my house but what I heard didn’t sound like my voice, instead it sounded weird like a demon. I’m not sure but I heard it speaking and listened carefully, I was horrified because it said “they’re coming…” Nice app but still stay safe guys"

BobR52,2021-12-03 03:48:50-07:00,2,0,Sleep Cycle Broken,I’ve been using Sleep Cycle for four years. In the last six months something has gotten broken. Sleep cycle can no longer identify the modulations of my sleep. It shows that I go into REM sleep and stay there the entire night. Reaching out to customer support has been useless because they refuse to pass on my concern to higher authorities. This is a disappointing outcome to what used to be a great app.

My cat snores a lot, so it usually picks him up and says I’m snoring. Also, when I wake up in the middle of the night for an hour or so trying to get back to sleep, it records me as sleeping."

I paid for a premium membership years ago, and now every day it’s asking me to “Try Premium” and making me log in to my account to access the features I’ve already purchased. In addition, it is no longer a reliable alarm. This morning, for the 3rd time in the last month, the app stopped a short time after going to sleep. Each time this has happened, I look at the log the next morning to see that it showed me asleep for about 30 minutes, then the app stopped."

Second, for some reason, and I can tell you that my sleep habits have not changed in the last few days; Over the last 4-5 days, my sleep quality has dropped from somewhere near the 80s to the 50s. Perhaps the app is too sensitive when it comes to detecting noises?

Third, the app keeps on recording ambulance sirens as me talking. Could you get that fixed too please?

Thank you."

Rakehellkat,2021-12-01 04:29:42-07:00,2,0,All the advice and advertising is really annoying,"I really like this app and used it years ago for a while.  Started using it again and I think it could be useful in decreasing any apnea from snoring.
But- it talks too much now, tips, adverts, everytime you use it it’s got something to say. For example- last night it flipped an ad to me right after I activated sleep mode but I would have had to click through the ad to actually have the phone start recording.  In consequence I didn’t get to track last nights sleep.
Also annoying because all the tips are basic boring stuff totally uninteresting to anyone who knows any science about sleep.
I wish there was a way to shut off tips, they make me angry 1st thing in the morning they’re so pedestrian and pedantic.  I wish I could turn off the ads they interfere with my use of the app.
It’s so disappointing bc the app is overall good but I wish there was a pay version without ads and tips.  Going to look for another app like sleep cycle but without the ads and ‘tips’ all the other incessant talking.  You’d think a sleep app would know how to be quiet lol!"

I always feel a refreshed as possible, I can’t remember a time where it hasn’t worked properly.

My husband has overslept several times because the app turns off and there’s no alarm, and he wakes at 5am some days. We have updated apps and phone software and still it continues. If we can’t figure out what’s causing it, I’ll probably cancel before our renewal in Feb."
wmdnfhsosm,2021-11-29 07:02:19-07:00,1,0,Snooze no longer works?,"One of my favorite things about this app was the “shake to snooze” where you could just shake or tap your phone to turn on snooze so you don’t have to actually unlock your phone and look at the bright screen. Since updating the app this no longer works. I can’t even find the setting anymore? Not only that but even unlocking my phone and physically pressing the snooze button doesn’t even work! So I was rudely awoken way too early today. I will not be using an alarm that I cannot snooze. That is absolutely ridiculous. 

Lately too I’ve been seeing several “baby fussing or crying” in my sleep sounds. I don’t have premium so I can’t listen to the sounds but I do not have a baby and I can assure you I don’t cry in my sleep so I’m not sure what that is all about.

One thing I think would be good is if you could edit your wake up time on sleep graph after you stop it each time. The reason is some times when I wake up and I’m not using the alarm, I forget to stop it and it shows an incorrect wake up time and hours asleep by the time I remember."

Nezteb,2021-11-23 22:01:52-07:00,1,0,Sleep aid sounds gone from entire app despite paying,"This app used to have various sleep aids of various kinds. My favorite were the long unexciting stories to lull you to sleep with a calming voice. Most of these aids are a paid premium feature, which I (still) pay for. Recently these have disappeared, leaving only sub-par (but decent enough) “ambience” noises to fall asleep to. I contacted support and they quickly replied saying to update the app manually, which I did. I told them it did not help, and thus far it has been radio silence from them. I’m hoping this review sparks some action. If they fix the issue the review will go to 5 stars, because other than this issue I love the app."

I don’t want to have another annual subscription but if I do, I don’t want to pay $30 for it.  I’m really only interested in the statistics and journal for a week at a time.  It also seemed kind of cruel to see that you’re coughing a lot at night and can’t listen to it to see if it’s even true unless you pay."

When it works reliably it’s a 5-star app, there have merely been a few times over the last few software versions where the alarm will freeze and not actually ever go off, which can be a risk for attempting to wake up early for something important."

Since updating to iOS 14 (or whenever the Focus modes were added as a feature), the app will close itself in the middle of the night and lose its data. That would usually be the worst thing, but since it is my only alarm, I also end up waking up late for work. My wife’s phone does the same thing. I have an iPhone 13 pro, and my wife has an 11 Pro. It has reproduced itself with iOS 15.

Tracy in Virginia,2021-11-21 19:53:22-07:00,5,0,Amazing,Been using app for a couple years. Very valuable data and like the recent updates to include more “sound machine” choices. Highly recommend this app to track your sleep. Tip: set alarm window for 20 minutes instead of 30.
Branshr40,2021-11-21 16:33:53-07:00,5,0,The Best Alarm/Sleep Journal App in the Store,"I have used this app for almost 3 years now and I can say that this is, without a doubt, the best alarm and sleep journal combo app that is on the app market today. You can use it for fee as a great alarm. If you decide to get a subscription, like me, you can monitor your sleep patterns, record your snoring/sleep talking, and actually improve your sleep without medication. I have always had a problem with waking up with other alarms. I used to use 3 or 4 alarms to wake up; however, this app’s Phillips hue integration and smart alarm option wakes me up during my lightest sleep with the lights gradually getting brighter so it’s an easy transition from asleep to awake. I never feel groggy anymore and I never wake up feeling exhausted. Like I said, I have had the sleep app for 3 years and it has never failed me yet."

I was nearly late for work when it did this! It did it again last night and I verified it was set before going to sleep. Thankfully it was the weekend. I’m going to have to find a new app for my alarm and sleep tracker as I need reliability.

I’ve taken steps to become healthier, increase # of steps I take per day, implemented tips on reducing snoring, started keeping a little daily diary which may help me glean info on how daily activity impacts my sleep habits."
krismouse,2021-11-21 07:36:26-07:00,5,0,Very helpful for chronic illness,"The most interesting information I get from this app is that my sleep quality is better than I thought. Because of fibromyalgia I always wake up sore and fatigued, as if I didn’t really sleep. The app shows whether that’s true (sometimes it is) or a distortion (which is often the case).

The app confirms that I take a long time to fall asleep — usually more than 30 minutes — and helps me track which practices alleviate or exacerbate this problem.

I *love* the gentle wake up that doesn’t go off until you’re no longer in deep sleep. It rarely wakes me abruptly from a deep sleep, and if it does, it's because my wake time is set earlier than usual. When I stick to my normal schedule, it's fantastic."

Aamays,2021-11-21 01:34:42-07:00,4,0,Reliable,I’ve been using this app for probably 6 years at this point and i use it almost every night. It used to be great because i had access to the data but now that it’s a monthly fee (that i don’t subscribe to) its lost a lot of its utility for me. I like it as a sleep aid and alarm clock and my own daily sleep notes but not being able to access the data after having paid for it all those years ago is sort of frustrating.
Hddjgffbjdvhxc,2021-11-20 23:36:32-07:00,4,0,"Big paywall, but the free part is good",All you get for free is the 30 min wake-up window that sounds the alarm based on the top of your sleep cycle.

Pnick1944,2021-11-20 06:53:10-07:00,4,0,I am learning to take charge of my day.,"Cycle provides me with a psychological approach to getting a better night's sleep. 
It is helpful to me to know the quantity and type of sleep I experienced overnight. By checking with Sleep Cycle each morning before getting out of bed, I can anticipate the kind of day I will have. (I.e.) I have a better day when Sleep Cycle reveals that I have slept a quantity of 6 hours and 85% quality. Following up with Sleep Cycle, I can predict how I will feel throughout the following day retiring to my bed at a particular hour."
Amjoy345,2021-11-20 06:50:30-07:00,5,0,Best,"I’ve been using this app for years now - 8 maybe? I started because I was interested in the gentle wake ups - I’d been struggling to get out of bed in the mornings, and my aggressive alarms woke me up but left me feeling agitated. The more gentle wake up has done wonders for my life. I eventually bought Phillips hue lights so the app can wake me up by slowly turning on the lights too. This is especially helpful for me in the winter, when waking up in pitch black night feels impossible. 

I love having historical data of how things have impacted my sleep. The app tracks location, weather, day of week, etc, and compares it to your sleep quality. I LOVE that you can use your own sleep tags to track data. For example, I track alcohol, my meds, the amount of sunlight, the amount/type of exercise, etc, to see how choices I make thru the day also impact my sleep. I’ve recommended this app to so many people and will continue to do so."

So many night of data completely lost if you accidentally swipe up and close the app before your alarm goes off or you tell it you’re done sleeping—it doesn’t even have a feature where it takes the data collected before the app closes, and says “welp, this is what your sleep looked like”. I’ve been a user for 4+ years—I would say 1/3 of my data has been lost due to this user issue, but it’s frustrating that the dev team hasn’t figured out a way to save this incomplete data without it being factored into the sleep analysis (perhaps a manual “don’t add this night” or a question when reopening the app like “hey we noticed you closed the app mid-collection”?)"

PorAhiVamos,2021-11-17 19:37:51-07:00,5,0,Good with limitations,"Super interesting app. Records your sleep noises if you keep it plugged in all night (wow I cough a lot!) and how long it takes to fall asleep, etc. 
You do need particular habits for it to work well. For example, I sleep with white noise, and I can’t really with this - the app records it.
Also, you need to set the alarm and then set the phone off for bed. If you set the alarm then use your phone, the app thinks you’re trying to fall asleep. Okay with me as it’s forced me to stay off the phone.
One fix I’d love is recording patterns for time awake at night or early morning. It tends to say I woke up at 6 and that’s not true - I woke up at 4 and couldn’t sleep for a while, but my app doesn’t present that information for me in a pattern."

My biggest complaint is sometimes the alarm turns off in the middle of the night. I also denied access to my microphone (my phone was saying it was recording even when it was on the accelerometer setting) so now I don’t see the banner at the top that would alert me to the app crashing. Three stars since the main thing it needs to do is have a steady, working alarm."

The alarms gently wake you, or even gradually wake you. And I no longer even need several alarms or a snooze. It’s pretty rare I even sleep through it either (anyone unsure can still set a backup). It’s a wonderful app. Very telling with how you sleep too. There’s many apps like this, but this one does it very well."

Darnedsock,2021-11-11 22:04:18-07:00,5,0,Excellent for SOME Tracking,"I use a few sleep apps. This was the first and still most fundamental. It is great at letting me know when and how much I snore. I can correlate that to tracking in other health and sleep apps and I’ve learned what contributes to that. For that alone, this app is indispensable. It’s ability to gently wake you and let you snooze your way to being awake is a game changer. 100%. 

We’re it to track movements and restlessness via Apple Watch and either have tagging or tie in with other health and diet tracking apps it’d be even better. We’re it to predict high and low energy points in your day it would be unstoppable.  It could do a bit better job demonstrating regularity and your rolling sleep debt."
Mediterranean Z,2021-11-11 13:46:33-07:00,3,0,Missing the Most Basic Alarm App Function - Automatic Settings,"I feel that the biggest problem with this app is that you have to open the app, and manually set the alarm/sleep tracker each night. That means if you fall asleep and forget to activate this, it’s useless to you. It’s incredibly frustrating. The automatic repeating alarm feature isn’t even available in the premium paid version, which is why I downgraded to the basic version. 

The app also will not be work if your phone battery is too low, so it must be on the charger and you must remember to manually set it before going to bed. Tough for people like myself who need their phone to help fall asleep lol. But I’m sure it will work for other people who can put their phone down early enough. How can you have an alarm that you can’t automatically set to wake you up at the same time every day? Makes no sense. 

BUT 

When I do remember to set the alarm manually, it works great. I love the calculations and analysis on my sleep level. It’s really important for me to track how much rest I am getting. This app does it so well and does help me wake up gently in the morning. So on that aspect, it’s 5/5 stars. They just need to update it with an automatic repeating alarm function."

I loved seeing when I would get up in the middle of the night, as I have a sleep-disorder. I enjoyed the sounds I woke up to, and that I could adjust the snooze feature.  I did have a few issues in the past; most of which have been resolved over time.  The only thing is that the vibration as backup for the alarm quit working correctly. Customer service told me that I could solve it my changing my wake up period or bedtime/wake up period, but I never needed to do that before, and I would prefer for it simply to work as it used to!  So if they could fix the vibration for the snooze feature, I’d give it 5 stars. Otherwise, it’s truly an amazing app!"

+H-man+,2021-11-10 06:40:43-07:00,5,0,My nightly ritual for 7 years,"I’ve used Sleep Cycle for over 7 years. The idea of using a standard alarm clock is barbaric. 

I’ve had extreme (extreme) difficulty waking up to alarms, and sleeping through important events, flights, jobs, etc. One of the best tools I have is Sleep Cycle. It’s so helpful to see what correlates with a good night of sleep in my life so I can make small decisions to sleep better.

Plus I have everything sync’d with my Hue lights so I wake up to a ‘sunny’ apartment year round. When I’ve travelled and woken up in the dark, I struggle much more to get out of bed.

Since it wakes you up in a time period (30 min default) where your sleep is lightest, the times that I wake up 10-15 earlier than needed are little bonus minutes I have before I get up for the day.

Love it, I’ve never even considered another method, no need."

I also like the sleep analytics and sound recordings that allow me to track some sleep elements. The one change I would suggest is to give you a readout of how many hours the alarm is set for like Apple’s alarm shows. Makes the amount of time you are giving yourself to sleep very apparent and also helps prevent mistakes on an vs pm for naps or other unusual alarm times.

As a long haul commercial pilot getting quality sleep and avoiding fatigue is one of our greatest threats.  By using this app it helps me identify the possible causes of my lack of a good night rest and see if my changes are working.

Although, as a novice app developer myself, I do understand the amount of work and effort that goes into developing an app like this but I have to say the price is a bit high. And I would also like to see more data that compares my sleep data to what it should be so I can set goals on my improvements. Otherwise it’s a great app and I would definitely recommend it."

This morning it acted like I never turned it on at all but I could see it in my open apps when you swipe up on the iPhone and could see that it was running. But when I went to turn it off it said I hadn’t recorded for 2 nights. It’s failed to wake me up twice now on a work day, luckily I set multiple alarms but this is my main alarm and I was still late. I thought the most recent update would fix it, so I did that yesterday and then this sleep just completely disappeared."
FotoJoe,2021-11-06 02:52:20-07:00,5,0,Sleep Cycle has changed my life. No joke.,"The way the app lets me know how much sleep I’m getting, what times I am in a shallow part of my sleep cycle, and waking me in a “window” of times I set up… It lets me have a much more rich sleeping experience. (basically every day except when my work schedule has me getting up at way different times each day. Even then, if I leave the right amount of sleep for getting up to work on those occasional 3 AM days, this app can still wake me up in the right window of time that I’m not groggy 🥴.) 
       Sleep Cycle is amazing. I don’t remember how much I paid for it, but the couple of bucks was well spent. I’ve been using it for at least 2 or 3 years so far; probably longer than that. 
       Just buy it. Your sleep will be way different. Way better.  —  Joe in Fairborn, Ohio  = )"

uvb67static,2021-11-02 02:34:14-07:00,4,0,So close to being really good.,"I’m not sure how the on-board mics on the phone catch everything, but based off of the discrepancies between this app and the others that do use my apple watch as part of their metric gathering choices, I’d like to know why this developer chose to forgo that option. 

This segways into my main complaint.  When perhaps all of your sensor data aren’t able to detect their surrounding, they (the sensors) aren’t able to perform as good a job that the wood have otherwise been able to.  For example, detect when a user took a nap or was just lying down. Both of these options are very doable via other apps on the market, sadly without all of you bells and whistles.  

My point is, you guys are so close to making a dominating app in this field.  I don’t believe anyone has beaten you yet, but if you don’t act soon by doing what you competitors are doing and adding in an automatic sleep detection function, it may only be a matter of time till you take that final long snooze."

cowgirlbob,2021-10-21 20:01:42-07:00,1,0,What happened?,"I used to have the pay version of this app and loved it. But over a year ago, it sometimes suddenly stopped working overnight and the alarm wouldn’t go off. I unsubscribed, but still used it, along with a separate alarm app, to track my sleep. Unfortunately, they have never fixed it. It now shuts off overnight (usually after three or four hours of sleep) more than it tracks, so I don’t get accurate information. After over five years as a loyal user, I am giving up on it and looking for better options. The sleep tracking function is important to me, and I have tried everything that they suggested (close all other apps and don’t charge overnight). I wish they would have fixed it when it first started having problems, but this has gone on much too long. I need to find a sleep tracker that actually works."
David Ensley,2021-10-21 17:56:09-07:00,5,0,Best way to wake,"Five stars for the alarm that senses the best time to wake you ever so gently. All the other features are worthless to me, but you really should try this smart and pleasant alarm."
twin-argonauts,2021-10-21 08:23:07-07:00,3,0,Inaccurate time asleep,"I really like this app and want to give it a chance, but it regularly severely misjudges my time asleep (sometimes up to two hours). It lists me as awake around the same time each morning, even while recording my snoring! This is probably because the AC and movement outside my window gets a bit noisier, but it’s disappointing to get data this inaccurate."
lost-city-girl,2021-10-21 04:56:48-07:00,5,0,amazing app!!,"i was skeptical of sleep cycles at first, but on only the first morning of using it, i noticed that i wasn’t tired at all!! here is how it works:

so you put in the time you need to wake up by (for me that is 6:00 am) and it makes a 30 minute window (so it would wake me up somewhere between 5:30 and 6). then, when you go to bed, you click start. i think it also has a 30 minute cushion for the time it takes you to fall asleep. (developers: if i am wrong here you should add this)

if you give it permission, the app will also open your microphone while running and track your sleep patterns through your breathing. you can always turn off this feature if you don’t like it.

there are also two other ways to use the app: as a normal alarm, and with no alarm but only a sleep analysis.

anyways, the body sleeps in cycles. so when you’re asleep you’re not actually fully asleep for like 80% of the time. the app puts together the time you went to bed with your sleep cycles so that it wakes you up while you’re in light sleep.

for me, a heavy sleeper and someone who takes an hour to get out of bed in the morning, (no joke, i’m late to class a lot) this app is extremely helpful.

if you read until here, i hope you decide to get this app. the developers have clearly worked very hard on it and deserve downloads for this magical wizardry. :) have a good day/night!"

Sam Bearcat,2021-10-13 08:29:20-07:00,3,0,Difficult to use with Apple Watch,"It is difficult to snooze Sleep Cycle on Apple Watch. It sometimes but not always, takes 2 taps to snooze. Seems random. After tapping once when the alarm vibrates a “stop” button appears right next to the “snooze” button. If you are off just a little Sleep Cycle will be turned off prematurely. Very frustrating. 

Also, there is no option for not setting an alarm when using Apple Watch. So on thhe weekends I have to set the alarm for much later than I expect to wake up.  

That leads me to my 3rd frustration; Sleep Cycle must be turned on manually every night and turned off manually in the morning. I would prefer these actions to happen automatically. 

I do like all of the information this app provides. The intelligent snooze has benefits and drawbacks. Benefit: snooze duration is reduced each time. So it wakes me up gradually. Drawback: I never know when the first snooze will occur. It’s different every morning. So I never know how much snooze time I have."
Ginger43211235,2021-10-13 06:32:05-07:00,3,1,What changed?,"Over a year ago I got this app, paid for premium. I enjoyed the insights! When I renewed this year I feel like it’s functionality has been cut in half. EVERY night it says I fall asleep at 9 minutes, even though I’m often up long past the 30 minute sound buffer they offer. One of many few sad inconsistencies that started popping up leaving me confused why after nights of tossing and turning suddenly my sleep is rated 100%. Also it pretty much just tracks my dog. Snoring and panting. And he does not sleep in my bed. I feel like this app took a deep dive down. And my refund won’t process as Apple won’t authorize it."

I downloaded this app on a whim to see if I snore at night but ended keeping it and paying for the premium version just for the gentle alarm system. I’ve always had an issue with alarms sending me into fight or flight mode or giving me little adrenaline rushes when they wake me up (no matter how quiet). But the gentle alarm system on this app slowly increases sound and i wake up after 10 minutes with no adrenaline rush. It may not be as useful for everyone but I really appreciate it."

Eeemia,2021-09-26 09:21:38-07:00,4,0,My thoughts,"First of all, this app is amazing. I normally have to set like five alarms to wake up in the morning, but with this I wake up so easily and it feels like the perfect time to wake up— I don’t know if that makes sense, but it’s like my body was ready to wake up. The alarm itself is such a peaceful little song and it doesn’t kill me every morning like the iPhone ones. I also seem to be in a good mood every morning, sunshiny, happy, even alert; and alertness in the early morning is a very foreign concept to me. 
A few things to note… 
1. Like most health apps, they have the premium thing which is a bit annoying but I don’t begrudge them of it, because they’ve spent a lot of time and effort to create such a good app, they should be making a profit. I just wish they put a few more things on the non premium side. You are able to see your information from the night without buying premium, just not all of it. That doesn’t bother me, I don’t really care about the information that much, just about falling asleep and waking easily. 
2. One thing I wish they put for free would be maybe an ocean or rain sound. They have lots of sounds but you have to get premium to listen to them, and I like to focus on sound to quiet my mind and relax my body, so that’s a bit frustrating. If I play an ocean sound from  Spotify, the app picks it up so I can’t listen to anything without headphones or earbuds. 
Even though that is annoying, what I’ve been doing is just playing my sound until I feel like I’m about to fall asleep, then I turn off the sound and start the app.
All in all, this is a pretty useful and awesome app."

I would go to sleep and turn on the alarm and set it on the nightstand to track my sleep. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and 3 times This past last week I have found the alarm off as if I had swiped up to turn it off as I used to do.

eipmac,2021-09-21 05:11:58-07:00,3,0,Helpful but for the money should do more,"The app has helped me get more regular about sleep and wake times - in much the same way as tracking food helps when I want to eat better. The “download” of the data however is a joke.  You can download a picture from the screen of one day’s sleep graph.  There are “statistics” relayed to various factors - moon phases, steps, and some you can add each day— on another screen but these are downloadable only one by one and again you only get a picture of a graph!  So I can’t make a graph of bedtime tracked against snoring for example, or bedtime against moon phases, or time in bed. I’d be better off with a pencil and paper beside my bed to take notes because pulling out the info needed to make a chart would be easier than this. For $30 I should actually be able to have the data to do with as I would like."

I HAD to set location services if I wanted to go on using the app. This startled me and I thought, “why would an app that tracks sleep would need to know exactly where I am located?” I concluded that this was a blatant and irresponsible attempt by the developer to mine personal data for money-making purposes. Most distressingly, it is data pertaining to my health and personal habits that is being collected by the app.  God knows what hands these data ends in. I immediately uninstalled the app. This is shameful."
WG533466,2021-09-17 01:59:46-07:00,3,0,Not great when you don’t sleep alone,"My husband travels for work, and when he’s gone, it’s not bad. (Not perfect, but not bad.) But when he’s home, it can’t differentiate between me and him. Yes, I know your partner can download the app and you link up your apps, but he’s not going to do that, and I wouldn’t ask him to. So Sleep Cycle thinks I slept half the amount I actually did last night, and thinks I snored for 1.5 hours (I don’t snore). 
The app also has really limited noise recognition capability and options. Noise outside of the window - birds, traffic, etc. - is heard as talking or movement."

I would be sad but would also pay a one time fee to keep the app with the fixing of the snooze feature on the smart alarm. Ps I’ve never paid for any other app

Sadly I heard from people that I have recommended this app (and now I see here as well) to that there is now a registration and required trial which everyone is turned off by.

Many times I have swiped by accident and did not mean to cancel the sleep cycle and get frustrated. It also does not help that if you start a new cycle if you accidentally swiped up, that it does not allow you to combine the new one with the previous one to get the real results of your night.

I’m a med student and this app is the bomb for sleep tracking. And it’s the best frickn alarm clock for someone with insomnia who then oversleeps because it wakes you up gradually. It also records noises you make while sleeping. It could be very useful for people who may have undiagnosed sleep apnea, because someone might not realize how much they actually snore, and this app could help them decide to see the doctor. (Which you should definitely do, because sleep apnea decreases your oxygen levels for many hours as you sleep, which then causes major heart issues!) The only thing I would like you to change is the very annoying pop-up window right before setting my alarm that tells me to turn on location settings."

It does not record my middle of the night wakefulness period, ever. I usually read during this period.

The final straw was yesterday. I did not wear my watch overnight. I had a computer project in the morning.

2 - Let us consolidate consecutive nights into one. This is to not ruin my average sleep duration when I either stop by swiping up to check how many hours I slept so far when I wake up in the middle of my sleep AND to allow biphasic or multiphasic sleepers to track how many hours they slept in a 24 hour period while maintaining their sleep average correctly.

SuzCorcoran,2021-08-27 03:41:05-07:00,5,0,A great way to monitor sleep!,I have a Oura ring and love these 2 to help keeping me accountable to getting enough sleep.
Bighoss72002,2021-08-26 20:28:54-07:00,5,0,Great for apnea treatment,"A wonderful app that works great and tracks your sleep fairly accurately for being an iPhone app. It helped with my sleep disorder diagnosis and treatment. 

Some things I would like to see is a greater variety of sleep aid noises (see: Noise Generator as an example) and the ability to maintain the sleep aid noises throughout the night with it maybe dialing down within the wake up window. 

The reason I’d like to see the longer sleep aid is because I suffer from a low arousal threshold when it comes to noises. So even the tiniest of noises wake me from deep cycle stages of sleep (stage 3 and REM). 

Ultimately, thank you for a wonderful app. Sleep is so incredibly important and in my job, for nearly 20 years now, it’s been a back burner type hygiene. Don’t wait. Download this app, improve your sleep habits and it’ll improve your quality of life."
revvvv123,2021-08-25 05:36:39-07:00,1,0,I in no way recommend this app.,You can’t do anything without starting the free trial and i set my alarm for 10:30 but got woken up at  8 and only got 5 hours of sleep I’m never using this app again.
Jim Bob 615,2021-08-24 05:22:16-07:00,3,0,Very frustrated with this Great App,1) Wonderful app. I have used it nearly every night since 2014 and have told so many people about it. 2) extremely frustrated that sleep cycle has joined the fray of requiring users to pay for yet another membership (plus “premium”). I understand it’s a business and business are for making money but I’ve been a plus member for 7 years and now they are asking for more money while putting zero effort into updating and improving the experience for long time members unless they join yet another membership. It’s sad.

I started setting a second alarm just in case and it happens all the time now. I don’t even bother with this app anymore. I don’t know what happened, the app was trustworthy for months before this.

JMCO47,2021-08-22 04:28:52-07:00,2,0,Very inaccurate,"If your partner possibly snores or is awake it might pick their movements up instead of just yours.

erin_quin,2021-08-19 07:35:39-07:00,2,0,Works Only When It Wants,"I used to love this app! I’m not a morning person and the soft alarm sounds to pull you out of a deep sleep into wakeness were amazing. Plus getting analytics of how your nights sleep went was an added bonus. However, over the past several months, the app has randomly stopped working. I will set my alarm and the app turns off overnight, disabling my alarm. More nights during the week than not I’ve been late to work because of it. Just last night I set my alarm at 10:30pm, I double check the red ring around the time in the upper left when I clicked to turn my screen off and on. I woke up at 3:30am because our AC made a weird noise. I checked the alarm at 3:30am and it was off, so I turned it back on again, double checking the red ring around the time. And it turned off AGAIN while I was asleep. I hate waking up to a regular alarm, but I guess I have to now. Sleep Cycle product team - can you please fix this? I’ve updated my phone, the app, turned my phone on and off, everything. It still works only when it wants to."

JV227,2021-08-19 04:58:42-07:00,1,1,Not worth the download.,"You don’t get enough features unless you pay, just another cash grab app. 

It records you, which isn't creepy at all, but it’s not accurate in the slightest, and if you want to do anything else, you pay. 

You can’t even listen to your own recordings. Like where do they go? Who is listening to you sleep?

Just another app, that has next to nothing unless you pay."
Zootanico,2021-08-18 23:08:12-07:00,5,0,Great for blackmail,"Let me tell you a story.
One evening while I was deep in slumber I was awaken by a loud rumbling noise. Was it an earthquake? No. Was is the water line breaking? No. It was my sister passing gas. She obviously denied it. Luckily for me sleep cycle recorded it. 
Now I have the recording forever and am able to send it to my sister to remind her that I own it therefore I own her and will blackmail her into buying me dinner."
HeadHunter,2021-08-18 14:15:26-07:00,5,0,A very good sleep app and it’s free!,"I am a person who has been living with chronic pain and little exercise for 17 years now. Sleep is always a problem.
In order to get a handle on ones sleep it’s necessary to first understand what is going on before during and after bedtime. I first downloaded the ShutEye and SleepWatch apps. 
SleepWatch is actually very good for a deeper analysis of your sleep minute by minute. And it’s free. Then of course premium offers many other options. They are not important to me. 
ShutEye requires a subscription. Which I have been paying for the past two months.
It turns out that this app, SleepCycle, does everything that ShutEye does with a subscription.
And! SleepCycle is also Apple’s editors choice.
I’ve canceled the ShutEye app.
I will probably keep SleepWatch for a while to follow just a couple little things that SleepCycle does not have. Nonetheless, SleepCycle is all that you need. It provides lots of insight and steers you towards appropriate changes that will help you sleep. I strongly recommend that you try it if this is what you’re looking for.
Great app. I am grateful it’s free."
Ice-Bound,2021-08-18 10:13:46-07:00,3,0,Neither accurate nor reliable,"It doesn’t seem to be aware of when I wake up and get up to walk around (I have Parkinson’s disease with a large helping of restless legs, plus sleep apnea). The wake-up window has never worked for me. The alarm goes off at the earliest possible time, even when by its  own metrics I am in deep sleep. Lately it has also frequently stopped tracking my sleep during the night - did it last night , in fact. Simply closes at a random time during the night. Fortunately I’m retired and don’t need to get up for work, though sometimes I do need to wake up for a doctor’s appointment. I’ve started relying on my Apple Watch for actual alarms. The only message I ever get from the app is something about sleep efficiency. It always gives the same number, and I can find no explanation of what that number means or how it is derived. My sleep is not so consistent that anything should be absolutely the same every single night. I keep using it for the tracking, though I’m not sure why, since it is obviously inaccurate. Also, the labels it gives for sounds are comical (for instance, baby crying, when I am single and in my 70s and live alone). But hearing the sounds is a premium feature, and I’m not about to pay for this, given its shortcomings, so I can’t “improve “ the labels."
akdnneie,2021-08-18 06:55:05-07:00,3,0,Pretty solid app.,good but what’s the point if you can’t even hear the recordings without paying? that was one of the reasons I got it. I never believed I snored or talked during my sleep but the app claimed that i did so i’d at least like to see if it’s true 😅 Other than that it’s a well developed app with no lagging or anything like that. I’m still going to use it!!
Muvment,2021-08-18 02:31:09-07:00,1,0,Was better. Now buggy.,"The app is cool, but had really gone downhill. It’s ability to interface with Philips Hues so often is a constant source of frustration. It’s loss of features does not help. Way to lose first mover advantage."
bellarae07,2021-08-16 22:47:35-07:00,1,1,😕,saw this app on tiktok and i downloaded with high expectations due to everyone talking so highly of it in the comments of the video. when i woke up the next morning i was very disappointed when i saw i had to pay $30 to hear the recording it takes of the sleep talking/snoring. i mean you think a recording of ME would be free for me to listen to right?? also i wish their was a monthly subscription rather a yearly one. would make it mush easier to try out the app and see if i like it rather giving just a week for a trial 👍

I wanted to track my patterns so I can see if the various menopause remedies I am using are helping. The apps information is so arbitrary I get nothing out of it. It tells me my sleep quality is between 82-86% of… what exactly? I know for certain that my sleep quality is about 60% of what it used to be. I prefer SnoreLabs technology and it doesn’t cost as much. Will be contacting Apple for a refund.

It caught a bunch of noises, however, I can't listen to them because I have to pay for PREMIUM. Honestly, it's not necessary to have to pay to listen to your sounds. I would give it a five-star review, but I don't think it's all that necessary to pay for premium to listen to snoring. I wanted to see how I sleep, and I wanted to track how long I have been sleeping for. 
     Besides that, it's an overall great app. But, I don't think I will be using it anymore, and not recommending it to anyone, unless you want to pay for premium."

I’ve used it for the last seven years, and thought it was a fairly good app up until the last 6 months. I have the premium version in order to sync and retain my sleep data. Worked great with Apple Watch for about 7 months, but has become progressively worse. Now, whenever I check the journal, it freezes with the second key stroke, and has to be restarted—EVERY time! Also, it’s recently stopped recording the heart rate. I have missed heart rate data the last two nights, and regularly miss it at least once a week. Virtually useless to me without consistent heart rate data. That’s the key to understanding a night’s sleep. Am a retired  physician, so that is a parameter I know is critical. I’m certain the watch is recording just fine, because other apps can access on the nights when Sleep Cycle does not record or correlate the heart rate data."

However, recently every night I will begin the app’s tracking feature yet when I wake up, nothing was recorded. I’ve tried many things to fix it - my phone is plugged in, ensure no other app is running in the background, check if I need to update the app. I’m thinking that crashes shortly after I begin it because it doesn’t record any information for the whole night. I set it every night yet it tracks only 1-3 nights. If this was fixed I’d be happy to rate it 5 stars but at this point I might look for a new sleep tracking app."
