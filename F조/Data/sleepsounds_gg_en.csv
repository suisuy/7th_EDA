"November 3, 2018","Love the adjustable sound settings. Making my own mix of soothing nature music isn't something I thought I would enjoy doing 😂 The timer also gave me assurance that it'll stop at the allocated duration when I fell asleep, and that means I don't wake up in the middle of the night having to turn it off myself. It's simply a very good app!",5
"August 4, 2021","Always manage to fall asleep within 30 minutes, usually takes me hours. Love the app!",5
"January 23, 2022","Really helpfull! There are so meany sounds for free! I love the ASMR sounds✨ Immaculate🙏 If your looking for a free sound app this is the best one i've tried by far, you can also cosimize your own sound if you dont like the ones already avalible!",5
"January 12, 2022",Best app. Really helped me cause I was having sleeping disorder.,5
"December 28, 2021",Helps me clear my mind of all the stressful thoughts. Along with a relaxing slip into sleep. Thx so much!,5
"January 18, 2022","EDIT: problem was with my old Huawei phone, not the app. New phone, it mutes on phone calls, so I now give it 5 stars. I would give this app 5 stars, except for one glaringly obvious oversight - it does not mute when answering a phone call! 🤐 It pauses while the phone is ringing but comes back on loud and clear once you answer. Very embarrassing if you take a call, and hard to pause or stop it while your caller hangs on. PLEASE FIX! Otherwise is helping my insomnia quite well.",5
"December 31, 2021","I have hardly any complaints! This app is marvelous. As a person with misophonia, I have trouble sleeping in the morning due to specific sounds. This app helps a lot. The main rain sound has good audio and it doesn't sound like horrible static or just a dripping pipe. Love the thunder, that really helps me rest. Although, I would appreciate more music, maybe. Just a few more sounds and it'll be perfect! Otherwise, it is quite the brilliant app. The limit is reached, or I would say more. 🤍⛈️🤍",5
"January 20, 2022","Woken up by ads! Ad banner in the app lets the ads have audio control and will have the ad talk about their product. Beyond annoying! Can't buy the app because because it's all subscription based where they charge $25/year or $5/month to listen ad free. The app itself is amazing though! With all that, it's time to move on to another app.",1
"January 6, 2022","My favourite sleep app, I particularly enjoy the loud adverts as you switch it on and settle down for bed, the biggest buzz is when you wake your partner up with it. Fantastic. Next app for me is some kind of military stealth one that sets off an alarm randomly during silent covert missions. Let's hope one exists! Five stars xxxxx",5
"January 17, 2022","best sleep app I've found. highly customizable, sounds are very authentic, & can be set to run for up to 8 hours which is pretty great as these sort of apps often stop before you want them to. i have Google Play Pass for 4.99$ a month, so don't experience any ads (super worth it btw) therefore- this is indeed, the Perfect sleep aid app",5
"January 16, 2022",Started out first night loving it. Ocean sounds. Second night set it for 2 hours. It did not shut itself off. Third night. Tried winter night. Crackling fire high winds. The winds stopped then i thought something was on fire hearing the crackling sound. I am going to try one more time.,3
"December 16, 2021","This app is awesome! I've tried other ones and they end up stopping after a little bit and I needed it to run all night long. This app runs until I stop it! And the customization is excellent! I can make the sounds my own to make my perfect sound! I have the perfect sounds for all my activities. They have a very good selection for relaxing, meditation and sleeping. And to top it all off it is FREE! I usually don't do reviews unless it absolutely deserves it. And this app definitely deserves it!",5
"December 7, 2021","Fabulous app that has been absolutely ruined by unskippable, bright screen ads. The only option to remove them is a subscription service. I can live with on screen ads but unavoidable loud bright videos is crossing the line. I've been using this app for a long time now and I'm so irritated with this recent development that I'm looking for a different app. Too bad, since otherwise it really is a nice and clean app.",2
"December 10, 2021","Love love love this app! I love that you can mix and match sounds. The sounds are a bit repetitive, but over all I found them very realistic and relaxing! The only thing that I think would make this app better is more variety in the rain, thunder, and fire sounds I love that I can close the app and still play the sounds. I'd also like to add that I'm subscribed to the play pass so I don't have to deal with ads.",5
"November 16, 2021","Sleep Sounds is a great app, especially for people that suffer from insomnia. I was skeptical at first, but it helped me sleep and recover me lost energy. My body got to rest and it helped my mind calm down. I also highly recommend it for people with anxiety disorder as it helps you become present. Sleep Sounds is an amazing app, I would never consider uninstalling it even when my phone has run out of storage.",5
"December 29, 2021","Sounds are good and you can add additional features to the basic sound. But when I use the timer, a little girl keeps saying hello repeatedly. Timer is useless.",3
"January 19, 2022",It is an awesome👏🏻 App. I didn't find any other App like this one. It is super easy and helpful. ☺Thank you so much for making it like this. You can add or change different sounds as you like.l love it!🤗,5
"November 20, 2021","Stop with the VIDEO ADS. Laying in bed, it's late... room is quiet, wife and infant baby are sleeping in the room... Go to put the rain noise on and the loudest ad ever imaginable comes on that you can't skip. Wife wakes up and gives you a death stare because you just woke the baby and her. There are plenty of apps that do this same thing, I am going to try and find another one.",1
"November 7, 2021",I really enjoy this app. It's useful not only for sleeping. I'm able to customize which sound I like best for the moment and adjust the volume for each. I love reading and I find myself being immersed more into the story while hearing some sort of peaceful sound in the background. My favorite is the thunderstorm.,5
"December 26, 2021","I've used this app to sleep for months. I get a good night sleep. It helps cancel out surrounding noises (sirens, loud neighbors and such 😃). It offers lots of options to customize what works best for you. I just wish I had found this app sooner.",5
"January 18, 2022",Great sleep sounds app! The ads aren't too disruptive and I love being able to customize my own sounds. Had to uninstall several for irritating ads but this one is a keeper!,5
"December 13, 2021","Bright, loud, unskippable ads in the Sept update. I'm trying to get to sleep, not wake up. And the only option is a subscription service? Highly customizable sounds, but I have to find a new app that won't wake me up when I'm trying to get to sleep.",2
"December 20, 2021","This app was great when it was just the banner ads but now they randomly put in loud video ads that you can't skip when you select one of the sounds....this is a big nuisance, especially late at night when you're about to go to bed....uninstalling, and looking for another.",2
"November 7, 2021","As others have said, this app used to be awesome, but the unscipable and LOUD 15 odd second adds are rediculous when you are lying down relaxed for bed and setting up a soundscape. The animation style of these adds are also very in your face and intense, which completely defeat the purpose of a wind down and relaxation routine before bed...",1
"November 7, 2021","I used to love this app, the customizations are great and i like that i can control the volume of just the app. HOWEVER, there's now video ads that you can't skip and are jarring when you're about to go to sleep! Not cool!",1
"November 8, 2021","Oh my God! This app is amazing I never thought this app make me feel free, Relax, and main thing when I sleeping I used to listen Rain sound with my choice. That what kind of rain I like. Thanks alot to the developers of this app. Waiting to see more updates in this app. Love you guys.",5
"November 5, 2021","This was a great app. The options are great, but when a very loud ad interrupts the calming white noise I put on to try to sleep it really makes it hard to like this app. Ads for this app should really be limited to visual banners only and not loud burger King commercials that interrupt the sounds at midnight.",2
"November 2, 2021","Love the sound to choose from and you can also customize to create so many more. If you are starting it for a child who is settled down or asleep, be sure the volume is down as it is no fun opening the app to a blaring ad. If you can remember that, you're golden.",5
"January 12, 2022","Was great before the update and now there are loads of ads. Little trick though, when an ad pops up just quit put of the app, close it and reopen the app again",2
"January 19, 2022","Really nice sounds. Can customize it to your liking, but when your trying to fall asleep and an ad come blaring on. Really ruins your sleep..",1
"November 22, 2021","i wish some parts of the ui were a little clearer, and that it used quieter ads, but overall i like this app pretty alright. if both of those issues could be resolved it would be a 5 star rating, easily.",3
"January 20, 2022",Down from 5 to 1 star. App will just randomly stop long before my timer. Frustrating because it will wake me up when it just stops like that.,1
"October 27, 2021","In the last few months or so, ads now load when you start playing a sound. It's very off-putting for something that is supposed to allow a person to relax. It doesn't make me want to purchase a version without ads--- it instead makes me no longer want to use it.",1
"November 12, 2021","Great for the most part, but the timer no longer works. To the developers: please fix the timer as it's useful when one needs to drown out ambient sound during the night, but not their early morning alarm.",3
"December 14, 2021","The different sounds all have wildly different volumes with some being to quiet to even use effectively, and I'm getting really sick of this app stopping the sounds randomly. I have no timer, don't suddenly pause the one single purpose of the app. Garbage, gonna make my own sometime",3
"December 10, 2021",It worked fine until 2021. It stops periodically and starts up by itself. As soon as I drift to go to sleep it stops it stops I started and again the cycle continues. I don't use it anymore.,2
"October 31, 2021","This works for me. Many options to combine sounds or use and modify pre-set items. A single ad, and then I set the sound I want, set the timer, and I'm asleep long before it stops.",5
"January 4, 2022","Yes, there are ads. But only to activate a new sound. Not in the middle of the night while sleeping. This is awesome",5
"November 6, 2021",Best sleep app by far. Plenty of sounds choice and timer. I use this every night due to tinitus and insomnia. I use it on my i pad and stick it under my pillow. Works great.,5
"November 18, 2021","Its been years since iam using this amazing app, all the sounds are beautiful and peaceful but the rain sounds ... Aah, because i love rain more than everything and these sounds make me feel like its really raining when i listen them, eyes closed This app is kind of my friend, best friend of an introvert.",5
"January 1, 2022",The sounds are of great quality and help my mind relax during the night. I have tried others and they do not hold up to these. I need these to sleep!,5
"December 30, 2021",Extremely easy to use. Love all the different sounds and combinations you can add in. Helps me fall asleep every night,5
"January 12, 2022","This app always gets me to sleep. And the sounds are soothing too.i really recommend this app since I can't sleep without me listening to this Best app. 100/100, would def recommend",5
"November 9, 2021","I really enjoy the different, Sleep Sounds that I can choose from each day and especially at night. Their very soothing and relaxing, especially after a hard day at work. I really appreciate knowing that I have them to look forward to every day.",5
"January 7, 2022",Very relaxing 😌 you can also put a Spotify playlist playing at the same time .it is so cool.can replace background sounds on ipad or android,5
"November 29, 2021",This app is an amazing experience and I live it. I do hear complaints about ads but I don't get any with the play pass so I really like this app,5
"September 24, 2021","I really enjoy falling asleep to these customized sounds. The customization of which sounds and the different volumes for each is wonderful! I don't appreciate the LOUD advertisements without the option to mute them, randomly playing when you try to open a sound scape. Advertisements on a free app are fine, but as loud as these are, for a calming sounds app, is ridiculous. There are other apps out there, for free, without this annoyance, I guess I'll be exploring them.",3
"December 9, 2021",I've had this app for three years..for the most part it's been awesome but lately before what I choose to listen to comes on I get a not so soothing app advertisement.,3
"November 7, 2021","Good sound choices. Would like the option to fade out when setting the timer, instead of the sounds just stopping abruptly.",4
"December 25, 2021",Just what I needed to help me sleep: a 30 second unskippable ad that takes you to their website regardless of which button you push at the end.,1
"October 20, 2021","I think this app has really helped me. I struggle to fall asleep a lot and it helps to calm my mind and slow my racing thoughts. The sounds are realistic and you don't notice any looping, which I notice on other similar apps. I just wish there was a paid version with once-off payment and you get to own the app.",5
"September 14, 2021","Great discount price!! (£4.50 for the first year)... lots of great soothing sounds, definitely something for everyone!! SMALL Room for improvement!: A few sounds do not sound authentic. E.g ""Snow"" sounds like a heavy scratching instead of the light, soft, sound that snow actually makes! Desert is just very windy. Thunder has rain sounds only when it thunders & then quiet inbetween, so you need to play it with rain too otherwise it sounds out of place & then it's too noisy! Great value!!!!**",4
"September 24, 2021","Used to be great. Now I can't turn it up to where I can hear it without it turning the sound completely off. The app doesn't shut down, the sound just turns off even though it says it's still playing. I've used this app for years and it's started to do this every night for the last several months randomly and no, there isn't a timer set. It makes no sense. 😩",2
"November 6, 2021","Phone gets warmer and drains more battery all of a sudden while using this app, only started happening recently, also it happens on multiple phones.",2
"December 10, 2021","Honestly the best app for creating your own atmosphere for sleep. Please add more sounds though, would really love some kind of underwater vibe.",5
"November 8, 2021","App has recently started to overuse my CPU, causing my battery to drain incredibly quickly. Used to be able to have sounds on all night, now I wake up to the sounds cutting off as my phone dies",3
"September 13, 2021","1. When you want to switch the sound, it inserts ads with loud sound which wakes you up completely. 2. Doesn't react to the stop button on the bluetooth phones. 3. When the phones are turned off, it... switches to the loudspeaker instead of stopping!",2
"October 5, 2021",I use it every day. It does what it's supposed to do. I can customize my sleep music and also set the timer. Ads are annoying sometimes when I'm in the middle of customizing my music but they rarely appear to me and you can also pay for the premium so still good for me!,5
"January 11, 2022",It's great! Limited adds and you get all the sounds you want without paying,5
"October 31, 2021","Wow, surprised by the sound file quality. Very wonderful selection and variety. So customizable haha! Thank you Sleep Sounds. I've been looking for a good Fireplace sound!! ☺",5
"December 21, 2021",Been using this app for 3 years now its the only thing that gets me to sleep and keeps me asleep love it. You can personalize your sounds as well best sleep music app.,5
"November 17, 2021",I love it! Best free app and doesn't require you to set up an account. It's easy to use. I recommend for you to try this app.,5
"October 20, 2021",Very nice app. Sounds are good. My go to is the brown noise with rain on window and wind blowing. Knocks me out everytime lol. The ads don't bother me much for it being free and they seem to only appear once every 2-3 nights before I lay down so sweetness!,5
"January 5, 2022",Best app. It's great. I'm using it. I really like this sleeping sound app. So beautiful. I absolutely love this app.👍🏻💯,5
"November 3, 2021","Love, love, love this app. Especially the Relax section. I like also that I can set a timer.",5
"December 22, 2021",I really enjoy having so many options to overlap sounds. My go to sleep aid for over a year.,5
"September 16, 2021","Really good. I've just tried it, want to support it. I'd pay whatever right now but I don't want to think about a SUBSCRIPTION when I'm trying to fall asleep. Now that I've written it and am... well, AWAKE... it sounds even dumber.",5
"October 25, 2021","I like it. Many options to choose from and variety. Only thing is the timer is not reliable. In the middle of the night it goes quiet and once I wake it, it starts playing again.",4
"November 18, 2021",Sounds modulate in intensity too much. Rain sounds do not sound like any rain I've ever heard.,2
"October 21, 2021","I used to use this app every night but now that they have added these ridiculous ads, I will be deleting it from my phone. This app is for relaxing and long, obnoxious ads just to even switch sounds is ridiculous.",2
"January 2, 2022",Very relaxing. The transition to sleep nightly is smooth & a blessing!,5
"December 16, 2021",It is a great app I have been getting very good sleep ever since I got and I love that it is aesthetic 🔥,5

"January 23, 2022","Great App, Beautiful UI, Easy To Navigate.",5
"September 11, 2021",sounds are so realistic. I don't sleep well. PTSD but this helps to relax me and eventually I drift off every time. Even if it is only a 45min Nap..all sleep Matters🙌,5
"September 14, 2021",Great app. I love how there are so many sounds to use. What I found funny was how chewing was an option.,5
"January 2, 2022",Used to be fine. Now riddled with ads. 0/10 just find a free one,1
"November 16, 2021",This Sleep Sounds app has so many sounds to choose from. I am really happy with it.,5
"September 28, 2021",Love this app! There is such a variety of sounds and the timer plus option to combine different sounds is a bonus!,5
"November 20, 2021",I love this app it's so relaxing and I use it often to get my baby to sleep ❤,4
"November 5, 2021","You can incorporate different types of sounds,giving you an option to choose from a variety of different ways. I sleep so well now .",5
"January 16, 2022",Best thing to listen to when you can't sleep or can't turn off,5
"November 12, 2021","Easy to use, love that you can mix sounds.",5

"September 12, 2021",Love having the timer as it really saves my phone from powering down. Just wish there were more available sounds,4
"October 15, 2021","I really enjoy this app, I wish that everything were free and that there were more soundscape options such as rain on a tent, underwater sounds or ocean front waves with seagulls for instance.",4
"September 16, 2021",New update is now just an ad farm. Multiple popup ads now. It stops itself to try to load ads.,1
"October 21, 2021",This app is what I use nightly to soothe me to sleep ..The fact that you can customize what sounds you want are a big plus..,5

"January 6, 2022",Installed this on my phone. Tried to use it. It put me into a never-ending cycle of ads. I couldn't get out of it without uninstalling. Never got to hear a sound. Found another app that's much better.,1
"October 31, 2021","I've been loving this app for years. Now, the sound will turn off without any warning and seemingly without reason. It wakes me out of a dead sleep. I can't use this app, anymore. I've tried reinstalling and it did not help. Samsung S20 Ultra 5G.",1
"September 28, 2021","I love this app,helped me a LOT.",5
"January 21, 2022",Variety to chose from. I personally like the calm.,5
"October 24, 2021",this app is perfect for sleep. because i was always distracted,5
"September 27, 2021",Love all the sounds and options,5
"November 7, 2021",I like the app my house is noisy so this helps to study,5
"October 23, 2021",Very nice app it really makes me feel real goodnight and nice sleep.,4
"December 19, 2021",Starting interrupting with ads,2
"November 3, 2021",It's so great it helps me to focus on study,5
"January 18, 2022",When I put on this app i can choose what i want to hear so thank you for this amzing app,5
"September 29, 2021","Incredible, you can create your own sleeping musics",5
"November 24, 2021",Its perfect for me. I enjoy using this app. Knocks me out into a good sleep petty quickly. No pop up ads. No extra data required. Therapeutic enough for me.,5
"August 1, 2021","What a crying shame that the developers eventually had to succumb to commercial pressure and start letting ads over-rule the app. The very LAST thing I want when selecting my sounds for the night is an advert for Facebook, of all things. If you're in a position to afford the premium version of the app then you may find it to be valuable. Back when it was ad-free, I LOVED it. I'd set it up for 15 minutes and invariably would be fast asleep long before that time was up.",2
"July 30, 2021","1st, I'm not being paid for my review. This is the Best app I've ever tried for help falling & staying asleep. I love how easy it is to use. How I can create the combo of sounds that I know help me drift off at night, and the option of a timer to have it cut off whenever I choose. I've also found it very help when my anxiety gets high. There's more than just sounds to sleep to! There's music & sounds for meditation & calming. I recommend giving at least a 1 night trial, you'll be hooked! 😴💤",5
"October 18, 2021",Once program works smoothly,4
"August 1, 2021","This sleep sounds app has it all! From relaxing ambience to the song of birds, there are a large variety of tunes to put you to sleep. Users can also play multiple sounds at once to create a custom sleeping environment. Ads are limited, and there is a cute hedgehog in the wallpaper waiting to greet you! It really deserves 5 stars.",5
"December 22, 2021",I use it every night to fall asleep listening to the sound of rain😊,5
"January 20, 2022",It is awesome but I need more songs.,5
"October 4, 2021",Welll... i now got the app bc my cousin has it so. Ibtried it and its not making me sleep but ill takw off youtube and see if it works but four stars for now ill go see if it works POSTED:,4
"November 4, 2021",Theres a bug in THUNDERSTORM. Pls fix it,1
"December 14, 2021",Sleep sounds this is so good app for sleep ya for sleepin try this is so goods sounds sowg yesss i telly this is so good app try now,5
"November 26, 2021",Probably the best sleeping app out there must try it out for sure!,5
"December 24, 2021",Great App and especially as it is free,5
"November 2, 2021",Was good till it started bombarding me with ads and making me wake up right when I was about to fall asleep. A yearly subscription for the app to fulfill a trivially basic function is insulting.,1
"August 25, 2021","Okay I've held off rating this app for a few years now but I gotta say this app is truly awesome!! What takes it over the top with general sounds is the customization of different kinds of sounds. Want to go to sleep in the forest, hear the rain, hey might as well throw in the sound of a steam while your at it?? Geeze you forgot fire, oh you also forgot sound of leaves too. Then if that wasn't enough you might find that the water in the stream is too loud, or the fire..sooo turn those down too!",5
"January 14, 2022",Best app I've found so far,5
"September 17, 2021","I swear by this app and recommend it to everyone I know who has sleep issues. There are so many options to choose from and you can even customize them. Once I found a sound that worked for me, I stuck with it and having been using it for years. I put it on and am almost immediately asleep. If you're looking for a way to relax and rest, this is your app.",5
"September 20, 2021",Love it ❤ I like the rain noises it's calming,5
"August 21, 2021","Is it possible to not throw in ads that have sound? Always so frustrating when trying to use this app to help myself and those in my household get to sleep and a loud, blaring ad pops up before the selected sleep sound. I don't mind the noise-less ads, but why would ads with music and sounds be used on an app that is all about winding down for sleep?",3
"January 24, 2022",I love this very much... It also has menus and during the update ASMR also came... This is the best app for sleeping and relaxing,5
"November 9, 2021",I really love this app! Super helpful for when you're stressed and when your baby doesn't want to sleep. Highly recommend!,5
"November 25, 2021",Love this app. Have used it for years.,5
"September 18, 2021","I'd give it zero stars if I could. This app is supposed to play sounds that are conducive to falling asleep. So why on Earth would it play an annoying ad for a game when you first select a sound to listen to? If an app like this is going to have ads, they should be silent.",1
"October 14, 2021",It really helps when I'm struggling to get to sleep.,5
"November 1, 2021",I give it 4 stars bcz of 1 reason: too much mb and my phone can't handle this much mb 😭😭,4
"August 30, 2021","(plz read my full review) It's amazing it really makes me sleepy as if it takes to another world, i really reccomend it and i also reccomend the relaxation plus snow, fire, ocean and window rain. And regarding the reviews that say there are too many ads there isn't so much ads that it will ruin you're experience. 5 stars you deserve it",5
"September 3, 2021","I love this app so much! I always use it when I'm writing anything on my phone or if I'm just trying to relax. There's so many calm things you can listen to, my favorites are the rain on leaves, and calm night. You can even make your own custom ones for free!",5
"October 10, 2021","Lol the ads with sound go against what the app is intended to be used for. No one wants to see or hear these ads, especially when your trying to sleep. I imagine the app would be decent without the ads but I cant afford to pay for that..",2
"August 17, 2021","I really love this app I've been having a hard time sleeping for years, this app has helped me so much with anxiety, rudeness and just helped me so much as a person and as a lifestyle. I enjoy this app alot because you have so much variety and I make my own choices and sounds. Either way this app is a 1000/10 and I would definitely use to help with sleep and meditation. (Not being forced)",5
"September 3, 2021",Works great until it doesn't. The app keeps crashing or something because the sounds work great and then they shut off. I have to keep going into the app to restart it. Other than that the app works great.,3
"September 23, 2021","Great app , only one that has worked for me 💚😴",5
"August 20, 2021","Good options for adding sounds and adjusting volume for individual sound effects- not just rain or forest noises either! I prefer the travel ones, since they have a definite rhythm to them.",5
"January 8, 2022",This app helps me sleep very well.,5
"September 24, 2021","the music is so good you can sleep, you know",5
"November 7, 2021",Works great for me. I would give 5 stars but every so often the ap closes in the middle of the night.,4
"January 2, 2022",Great app. Love using it. Helps me calm down and go to sleep faster,4
"November 24, 2021",The variety of sounds is quite large.,5
"November 17, 2021",Great app.....puts you to sleep beautifully,5
"June 13, 2019","Great app! I love the fact that it plays all night long (you'll want to keep your phone plugged in). No discernible audio loops or cuts, no gradual diminution of the sound over time, no cutting off abruptly when the phone sleeps, just soothing sounds to lull you to sleep. And all are fully customizable. I like the ""Vivid Creek"" sound, with a little bit of crickets in the background.",5
"November 27, 2021",Melts the stress away and helps me sleep better. would recommend this app for anyone who has trouble falling asleep after a long day.,5
"September 16, 2021",Love so many options. It actually helps.,5
"November 22, 2019","Great app, really helps me relax and sleep. It has a lot of options that you can layer on top of each other at different volumes (love the train+rain+wind). The ability to set a timer is amazing. Also underrated feature but it doesn't keep the screen on while playing- so I don't have to worry about that. All in all, does it's job beautifully with high-quality sounds (and some music options!) would recommend if you like white noise that isn't just static.",5
"October 20, 2018","Wow ! Absolutely love it ! I'm gonna pay to get rid of the ads... but not because the ads are even annoying me, but just to throw a little support your way ! This is just one of those apps. thats a no brainier...you just gotta have it installed... it's as important to me as my email,eBay or Facebook . In fact I listen to it in the background while I'm on eBay and Facebook . It calms be down while I'm working so anytime I'm working on ebay I've got this in the background and listening to the rain on the windows....it's so relaxing to me .",5
"June 11, 2019","I like the custom option. I use it instead of the premade options. Those options are great, but I have sensory processing issues so it's nice to be able to make my own sound mix. It also keeps running even if I clear all my apps which is nice bc sometimes I clear all accidentally. It doesn't stop playing after a set time like an hour, some automatically do that, but this one stays on all night bc I want it to.",5
"January 16, 2022",Awful ad placement. Should be ashamed,1
"October 23, 2021",Really helpful when am try to gets sleep,5
"September 10, 2020","I really enjoyed this app for awhile. There is a very nice variety of sounds to mix for your own particular sound. However, the ads are very intrusive. I don't believe in complaining about ads in a free ap. That's just the way it is. There is only one when you set up your sound but it is a loud video ad. I woke up my husband several nights in a row while simply trying to set up my sound for the night. If it was silent, I'd give it five stars. Otherwise, the jarring ads dropped it to a three.",3
"December 5, 2021",LOUD Ads block sounds,1
"October 7, 2019","I have this app for about a month now. It's amazing! ! I travel a lot and there's always some type of noise, usually traffic. Closing windows unfortunately isn't an option for me. It has 18 choices, I have 3 favorites, the rain with thunder, a cabin with wood crackling and of course the woods. The best thing is that each choice allows for additional sounds. How amazing is that! Ever since, I've been sleeping like a baby! THANK YOU!!! I'd rant & rave about more but there's a character limit! 😉❤",5
"November 20, 2019","Simply Excellent, loads of different sounds to choose from as well. Currently I'm using the train, and the rain hitting the window simultaneously. Love it a brilliant soothing helpful app. Download now, and it's free as well. No ads either. Get a good nights sleep with this app, or simply close your eyes an relax for a while. I give this App. 10 out of 10. Personally For 8 hrs use it usually takes 25% of the battery",5
"August 26, 2019","This is by far the best ambient noise app I've used. What they have compared to all the others is the ability to mix multiple sounds at the same time AND control the volume of each ""noise"" independently of the others turned on. The sounds are much more realistic as well. I usually have to fall asleep with the TV on because I have to ""focus"" on something independently of what's going through my mind or I can't asleep. Adds and in app purchases aren't pop-up and don't ""nag"" you to buy etc..",5
"October 8, 2018","I love this app. If you have trouble sleeping this app is perfect to help you drift off to sleep. I love the huge selection of of arranged sounds with nice pictures to give you a better option & make it easier to get the idea of what the sound will be like. You can also choose any sounds you want to play together or separately. For example on cold nights now with the winter, the I use the ""Winter Cottage"" option with the distant sound of wind in the background & a calming crackling fire it's so relaxing just like the snow lodge on the pic. If your not sure choose the photo it shows that reflects your taste or mood. Amazing app. Thanks for making! :)",5
"August 15, 2021","Love the app, it's just what I needed, I recommend it to my friends. Keep up the great work Devs. I will continue to use this app until the cows come home, need I say more! UPDATE 2021.08.15 still using the app every night 👍👍",5
"January 16, 2022","Works very well. Some adds, but not too bad. I use it every night. Puts me to sleep!!",5
"October 4, 2019","Very relaxing and love the customizing sounds the app provides. Job well done! You came to me because an update to my phone prevented a competitors app from working. My wife and I used the app every night. The search was on, didn't think I could find an app to replace it. I was wrong. Sleep Sounds was a gift from God. Way better than the competitors app. Thank you!",5
"October 15, 2018",Cured my insomnia for $1. I'm not sure if I even needed to pay but they deserved the dollar for sure. I was going to pay $30 for a sound machine but this is way better. You can customize your sounds! I use the desert sound mixed with 80% peaceful background music and 25% frogs. It puts me to sleep within 15 minutes instead of 2 hours! 5 stars!!! Lots of options and customizing as well as being able to set a timer.,5
"January 1, 2019","Rather good but....I really like this app, the customisable sounds are really nicely done, but there's an irritating issue. These sounds are on a loop I guess and either when they end or start (not sure which) there's a half second of white noise. When you're trying to go to sleep you land up focussing on the white noise which keeps me awake! Can this be fixed? If so, 5 stars.",4
"December 4, 2018","I love this app! It helps me fall asleep and block out noises while studying without distracting myself with music. Sometimes I even listen while walking to class to relax or to ease my mind before a big exam. You can use the preset sounds or mix a variety of sounds to make your own, and you can even set a timer, so it will turn off automatically if you want to use it to fall asleep.",5
"September 10, 2021","I love the fact you can add and mix sounds. You can have a timer for the sound to go off, or just let it play continuously. It's an awesome app.",5
"February 23, 2019","I often have trouble falling asleep but since discovering this app I fall asleep faster and have a more relaxed & restorative sleep experience! I really like having the options of adding or subtracting the various sounds as well as the option of using the timer. I like that I can drift off to sleep in a rainforest, a cabin, in the woods or on the beach! I highly recommend this app , its so meditative and peaceful!",5
"December 3, 2019","I've had this app before and I absolutely loved it,couldn't sleep without it. Using it for about 3 or 4 years now.Tried others, but didn't like the instrumental music in the background. For me I found that to be too overstimulating for trying to fall asleep.Made my mind engage when I wanted it to do the opposite,lol. So this app was perfect for me. And I love that I can personalise the sound settings. I get my best sleep with this app, I love it so much.",5
"October 12, 2018","I really appreciate this app. I also like others say, enjoy the true natural sounds available and how you can add other sound elements to make it better for your own needs. I just tried a very well known ""sleep hypnosis"" app with a free 7 day trial and it did not do for me what Sleep Sounds has done. Thank you for a job well done!",5
"December 30, 2021",As a chronic insomniac with anxiety and panic attacks this app comes in great handy.,4
"August 29, 2019","The sounds are very realistic and I love that I can add other sounds and control the volume of every sound separately. Helps to drown out my husband's snoring & relax me at the same time. The only issue I have is that after turning it on at night, about a half hour later, it turns the sound off and then back on & it wakes me every time. If that was fixed, this would get 5 stars from me! Otherwise, great app!",4
"October 12, 2021","This app is fantastic, that's all I can say, highly recommend",5
"January 24, 2021",This is one of the most amazing nature apps that I have for sleeping! This nature sounds app puts me to sleep every night ! I'm usually asleep within the hour .I recommend it to everyone who has trouble sleeping .You can customize it to add sounds so you can combine the different sounds together. I enjoy the ocean with the rain on the window! Happy sleeping ! 💜,5
"April 24, 2020","As someone who is a sensitive sleeper and finds it hard to settle down at night, I found this app really helpful and have been using it for a few weeks now. However I was trying to sleep when all of a sudden the app was crashing. It disrupt my sleep as I listened to the rain audio since different intensities of rain started blasting through my earphones. The app clearly started bugging out. Apart from that I really do love using this app and hope the bug gets fixed soon!",3
"September 12, 2019",I use this app regularly and am about to introduce it to my kitten for the first time. He hates everything so his opinion is irrelevant. I'm already certain he hates it. I on the other hand love how I can add different sounds in and adjust the volume. The built in timer to turn itself is by far the best feature. My favourite app that doesn't result in news or food 👍,5
"January 13, 2019","This app is really nice. Very simple, and I love the sounds. One suggestion I'd like to make to the developer is to make the volume slider control ONLY the sound of the Sleep Sounds app. Sometimes, i want it to play lower than something else running in the background (usually Audible), but the app's volume slider changes the volume of both itself AND Audible. If you could fix this, it would be the perfect app.",5
"January 31, 2019",this app is amazing and I have told everyone about it. I fall asleep so quickly now. I love that its customizable and the sounds sound organic and are also volume controlled as you please. we use this though our bluetooth speaker and it's just lovely. there are so many combinations of sounds that you're really able to dial in what's relaxing for you! i promise you wont hate this. its lovely,5
"October 16, 2018","Outstanding! I love how you can mix different sounds together as you wish... like wind and rain..., creek water and crickets..., rain, thunder, and frogs..., etc. You can mix up to 8 different sounds and adjust each sound's volume independently. You can customize the premade sound selections. Just excellent! And the app is data free offline.",5
"April 4, 2019",I love it! my fan broke and I need that sound to get to sleep. Using the airplane sound mimics the fan amazingly well. Not only am I getting to sleep quicker I am staying asleep. And the timer selection!! Fantastic! Set it for 40 mins every night. Dont think it takes me anywhere near that time to fall asleep but it's nice to have the option. You can add different sounds like for rain you can add thunder. Great app! I LOVE IT!,5
"November 7, 2018","I have been under a lot of stress, and am in physical pain a lot as well, making sleep, very hard to come by much of the time. This app is so soothing, and allows me to free my thoughts, and relax, allowing sleep to come easier. Also the timer, and different app sounds, make for a perfect atmosphere to relax. Love, love, love, this app. I highly recommend it. Thank you so much. 💖😊",5
"October 21, 2021","Good app most of the time. There are times when it stops playing, but I have found this app to be more reliable than other sleep apps.",4
"October 14, 2019","I've tried a few other apps and wasn't happy. This app has soothing sounds, many great free options, does not turn off when my phone goes to Sleep Mode. Has a timer option too. I often have trouble staying asleep because my mind is racing or my husband's snoring. These sounds help to drown out everything else so I can relax.",5
"October 28, 2018","Best found so far, hands down! So many of these noise apps have a short duration/ repeat reel, all of which have a brief silence when starting anew. When trying to use a constant noise to help you sleep, the worst thing that can happen is for there to be an abrupt stop, no matter how brief. This one does not! And with the timer for it to go off, I can use it just for a short period or all night (which comes in handy for week days versus weekends where I live). Also, when it stops on the timer, it's not abrupt- it fades out. And the fact that you can overlap different sounds, and have each of them at different volumes/ intensities within the mix is so, so great. Kudos to those who created this. Clearly you have knowledge and experience if how to make this successful for people.",5
"October 26, 2019","It's very easy to use this app. You can mix various sounds (such as sounds of rain, crickets, piano, etc...). Very relaxing, cancels out most sounds when i have the app on, helped me a lot with sleeping. Great app, recomend it to anyone that has trouble sleeping or likes the sounds of nature, even when you have a very noisy house (kids, people that watch tv, etc...).",5
"March 1, 2019","I love this app so much! i cannot say how amazing this app is. I have 2 sons with autism and its always hard to get the to fall asleep. when I turn on the rainforest sounds or the cave, they are lulled right to sleep. I use it for myself as well and I am out within the first 20 mins of the winter cabin. lol. love it! 5 stars. ps: the timet feature is awesome! good job.",5
"July 2, 2019","This is a very well designed app. it has a simple and picturesque display. It allows you to customize your sleep sound by mixing in up to three more sounds and adjusting the volume of each one. My favorite is rain on window at 100% with 50% of wind, airplane, and rain. lots of other high quality relaxing sounds. The ads are not bothersome, the sounds are high quality, and looped perfectly. I've never heard anything but smooth sounds. This is an incredible app!",5
"January 6, 2019","Love it. Love it. Love it. I'm a lite sleeper & the smallest things wake me up, so the fact that there's no end time (will play non-stop) has helped me sleep better & also the fact hat you have sooo many options (background noise types) & I can customize it ALL to what I want (add animals, harp, piano, turn it up or down). Omg!!! LOVE this app. Thank you.",5
"October 1, 2020","Amazing experience with this app, as there are so many sounds and you can add more to the existing presets or you can make your own custom sound. Then you can set a time and it turns off the sound when the timer is up. There are also many sounds like: rain, rain on the window, the desert, a vintage train and white, brown and pink noise. Then you can add crickets and fire crackling and more. I have had many sleepful nights and I enjoy the app so much thanks.",5
"June 26, 2019","This app is perfection! I can choose a forest setting or a quite cave, then I can change the variety of sounds within the setting. If I want to hear an owl hooting in the distance while driving down a rainy highway with a campfire, the app would let me! Seriously, any combo. You can adjust each sounds individual volume as well. Too much cave drips? Turn it down. Too much lightning? Turn it down. It also gives you four soothing musical tones with that you can also add in. Another huge plus is you can adjust your time limit. I know I have zonked out after 10 minutes with this app, but I can set it for 1 hour, two hours, forever, or even my own custom one. Best. App. Ever!",5
"December 9, 2019","I'm enjoying all of the sound options. And I use the app nightly without fail. My husband also loves it. Very soothing, and I love the custom timer feature. The additional sounds, like the moving old fashioned train is amazing. I love travel by train. But my absolute favorite is rain/ thunder/wind. I highly recommend this app for winding down and before bed. I always rest well and feel refreshed in the morning 😊",5
"September 11, 2019",This app is the only way I can fall asleeep during my depressive episodes and bouts of anxiety. I love that you can set a timer for it to turn off on it's own. I love the manual choices you can add together and that each option has it's own volume control. I don't think I'd change anything other than being able to save and name several choices at a time. I DEFINITELY share this app with anyone who listens to me!,5
"September 8, 2021","I love all of the options, especially how you can make your own mix with the various calming sounds available.",5
"November 10, 2021","I have insomnia and its a special one It has these triggers th as t allow me to sleep my triggers are nature sounds, storys, I prefer rain and horror stories.",5
"February 10, 2021","Used to love this app, really love it. It worked so well but now I can't stand the very obnoxious long adverts in it. One wonders what kind of person would respond to such annoying adverts. I get that it is hard to monetise. But this attempt likely will reduce users to almost nothing. Will probably buy an actual device.",1
"December 13, 2019",If you cannot fall asleep good by yourself I highly suggest this app. There is a bunch of different soothing sounds and settings I can listen to something different every night of the week and trust that it will keepe relaxed and at ease. And it's great because there is also a timer so you can set the timer and not worry about it running all night long. 10/10 will probably never delete. I'll honestly most likely download it on my next phone too.,5
"December 11, 2018","Great app but really wish the app would rotate from portrait to landscape to enable tablet use or kickstand devices. This is truly meant for an upright phone. Add an update with rotation, more music and animal sounds and its a solid 5 star with my another purchase. I purchased this before on my old gmail and it really is a solid app for basic nature/meditation sfx. I love it but its a few improvements around the corner from being a home run. I will change to a 5 star if an update can fix these issues. Then ill definatly purchase ad free again. I will commend them for not making invasive ads which makes it easier to utilize free version. Entise me to buy paid version with those enhanced features.",4
"January 28, 2019",This is a great app. The only problem with ir is the developers haven't put a back button in the app pages to get back to the home screen & menu. Once you arrive at your first choice of sound there's no going back without closing the app or using the phones back button. I'm being fussy it's possible to get back to the menu & home screen but not from within the app OF course the add at the bottom of the page may be hiding a menu bar under it & the user just can't see it until the adds are paid to,3
"June 29, 2020","Really good! Helps me to get to sleep almost right away. Stops your mind from running on and worrying about everything. You listen to the sounds and you drift off to sleep. Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of the advert. This advert is not really intrusive, it doesn't cut in on the sound like a radio does with adverts and the news. Ths sounds are continuous like a long piece of music with no end, no middle and doesn't start and stop, it just keeps moving. A lot of choice in the sounds.",4
"January 28, 2021","I really liked this app for getting to sleep at night. I used it every night as the ability to choose my own mix of sounds, to get sleep helpped relax me. Tonight I couldn't find it and noticed it had moved because of a update. Now they have introduced ads, unless you pay money. I have uninstalled can't afford to pay for a good night's sleep.",1
"December 19, 2018",The customisable section of this app is excellent. I haven't slept so well in weeks. I hope you keep adding and expanding to it. For this to be free makes it a must for anyone who needs help drifting off or relaxing. The choices you make keep playing after you suspend your phone and you can set a timer which is brilliant. You can pay 99p to get rid of the adds but they're not really intrusive. I'd happily pay 99p to get access to more content if you expanded the app. Thanks developers 👍🏻,5
"June 11, 2020","You have many sounds that will help you and your baby to fall and stay asleep. I like the selection of sounds, nature, transport, white noise. I am, however missing the sound of people chatting constantly and indistinguishably, like in a market or a cafe. Like that you can adapt and change the sounds according to your needs, wishes, desires, add or take away layers of sounds. Also like the timer, which should switch the app off in a desired timeframe, although I have had problems with this.",5
"January 13, 2022","this days are ma exams and because pf reading my mind just can't reast for a min soo thank you for inviting this app this is soo, much helpful for students 💫💫❤️🥀",5
"August 21, 2019",I use the custom sounds as I prefer them and have found that have found this app does what it says. It also plays in the background when other apps play media so it means I can play the music from here in the background while I also play my meditations and when they finish this continues to help me drift off to sleep. I love it.,5
"October 6, 2018","The description and reviews were persuasive. Compared to similar apps I've tried, I found this one's sounds oddly unsatisfying. Maybe it's how they were recorded, or the fidelity, but they didn't sound clear or realistic to me. To be fair, I'm a musician—so if you're not as particular about sound quality or realism, you may find this OK.",3
"November 17, 2019","Does exactly what I want it to do. Plenty of sound options but would love to see some household sounds. Used to use a sleep app that had sounds like a washer/dryer, ceiling fans, traffic, trains and even barking dogs and howling wolves and you could set how often they would bark/howl and let you set how often you'd hear thunder and such. Would love to see that in this app.",5
"May 30, 2020","When the other app I used to use went to a subscription service to give you all the sounds and left you with less than half if you didn't sub, this was the best alternative I used. The sounds are pretty crisp, and it's easy enough to navigate. I just wish one of the sounds available was windchimes! That'd make it perfect for me.",5
"January 16, 2020","Really good app because you can set a timer to help you drift off to sleep. There are plenty of soothing sounds to choose from including personalising the sound with other sounds included in the app. Which then allows you to create an orchestra of natural sounds. Easy to use, with no adds when you are offline. Really does stop a chattering mind and soothes you to sleep.",5
"July 16, 2020","Really good app, occasionally when I turn it on and set a timer for 60 minutes, it's still going when my alarm goes off hours later. I haven't figured out why. I still use it and really enjoy it though. Ability to mix sound levels and create new mixes is great. I really like the fact that there are no obvious ""audio cues"" that make it easy to tell when a clip has looped, I find those distracting because I start paying attention and just stay awake.",5
"November 25, 2018","Helps me fall asleep quickly in a noisy apartment. Has many choices; I like the rain best. You can even adjust other sounds, like the frequency of thunder. You can set a timer so it is not running all night. I've been so happy with this app. No need to buy a sound machine. Just let it play as you charge your phone by the bed.",5
"March 29, 2019","4 stars! it is very rare that I give 4 stars because I believe in leaving room for improvement, and of course I'm still leaving room, but wow! this app is seriously so good! it helps me fall asleep quickly and stay asleep. my only recommendation for the creators of this app is MORE OPTIONS! the fact that we can make a mix of our own, is fantastic but more sounds could mean better sleep!",4
"March 7, 2019","I may just be odd, but this doesn't quite work for me. I find the ""outdoors"" sounds, like the sea or the rainforest, rather unrelaxing (I don't sleep outdoors, after all) and the sound of rain against the window just makes me anxious. But then, I do live on a flood plain, so that could explain things. The harp music in combination with the winter cottage is probably the best one of the lot.",3
"January 5, 2019","I often lay awake for hours in bed, since it is a troublesome time for me right now. My brain is firing up late night, thinking about anything but sleep. Once I set my timer to 20 minutes in this app, though, I am never awake to hear it go quiet! Also, battery is still fresh in the morning :) Big thanks!",5
"May 31, 2019",I've been using Headspace sleep sounds for over a year and thought nothing free would be comparable. This might be better. You create your own sound. Once you start working with it (it's simple) you'll see how great it is to make the sound that you find most soothing and sleep-inducing. Bye Headspace.,5
"September 14, 2019","Helps me go to sleep easier and longer, doesnt kill my phone battery quickly either, especially since it has a timer that you can personally set if you want to so it'll just go off on its own. I personally like this app and use it just about every night. The only time I dont use it is when I fall asleep without my phone. So far its my favorite app on my phone.",5
"January 22, 2021","I am enjoying this app and am finding it quite useful. Not all the sounds are to my taste but there is enough of a variety for me to have some favorites. I really appreciate the customization features, especially brown noise and campfire. It's nice to drift off to sleep to the crackle of a fire with the snow coming down outside.",5
"August 20, 2019","Perfect! I only wish you could have more than 8 custom sounds, but I think that's because it starts to skip and sound staticky if you have too many. Anywho, I can't sleep without this, it's a life saver for sure. And it's great for helping kids sleep or take naps when you're on the road or just at someone else's house, anywhere they aren't used to napping/sleeping. Someday I hope they upgrade it to even more variety, different nature sounds, etc, but overall this is an excellent product. 👍🏼",5
"September 29, 2018",Soooooo good! It has beautiful accurate sounds of lovely calming things and I love how u can adjust them by adding different sounds and changing the volume. And it's super cool how u can make your own one! Totally recommend. What's rlly handy is u can listen to it off the app and with the phone off. If your trying to get to sleep u can keep it on for a certain amount of time and it will turn off for u so u can just drift into sleep! Love it and Thank U! 💗,5
"January 27, 2019","I love sleep sounds! exactly what I was looking for. I have struggled with needing background sound to sleep for years. I was falling asleep to the TV most nights, but woke up often and didn't always get a restful sleep. I've transitioned to the natural soothing sounds on this app and am now getting a full; restful night's sleep. I highly recommend this app.",5
"February 26, 2019","I listen mostly on the train and in the air. the white noise is so relaxing. sometimes I will also add the ""zen"" music option with the train. It's rhythmic and relaxing. I also like the nighttime sounds. I use it at night when it is cold because the calm night selection sounds like nighttime during the summer.",5
"January 19, 2020",I've tried so many different sleep apps with different levels of success. But this is the one I always come back to. I suffer with insomnia and nyctophobia so having a free app with so many sounds and options is a huge blessing. Being able to add and take away different noises as well as being able to adjust volumes individually is a great touch. Thank you for making my nights a little easier. The simplicity of it is what makes it so reliable.,5
"October 18, 2018",I love it! Never thought I would ever fall asleep or want to fall asleep to something like this but now I look forward to picking a sound and making it mine. I also like the shut off timer because I know I personally would wake up because it was on. Super easy to use and great selection of sounds and possible combinations.,5
"September 21, 2021",Love the ability to create my own combinations!,5
"October 11, 2018","Very simple to use and very effective high quality sounds. Easy to custom make sounds to your liking. Volume controls adjustable is a great feature. Timer included which is awesome. Only thing I'd like to see more of is more sound choices. Not a bad thing to have more than what it already has. Good selection as is though. Helps me on my toughest nights. Thankyou, keep up the good work.",5
"July 29, 2020","This app is perfect for getting the sounds you want to fall asleep to. I like to combine the rain on leaves sound with some music and bird call, and maybe some rustling reeds. Most importantly, you can set a timer to turn off the sounds automatically. The app is designed really well; simple, intuitive, and have thought of what you want from this kind of app. Even the ad at the start is quiet and not jarring. I'm impressed I can get all this in the unpaid version.",5
"February 27, 2019","My absolute favorite app!!! this has helped me sleep so much. I especially love that you can customize your own sounds, ans that there are musical elements you can use. with other noise apps ive found that they are flooded with ads, however this one isn't. i am in love with this app and cam realky see no way to improve it.",5
"November 5, 2018","Wow! Does it work ever...been suffering from Insomnia for decades now and even with medication it's difficult to fall asleep. I discovered this app, so I click on it to start it when I'm ready for bed and I'm usually ""out"" in less than 10 minutes. I'll have to ""tweak"" the settings a little bit to find the right combination of sounds and time...it can cause me to wake up when the timer goes off. Absolutely love this app. Genious! Wish I'd discovered it much sooner. Thanks.",5
"October 25, 2018",Sleep sounds is amazing. It can get me to sleep in like 5 minutes. What I really like about sleep sounds is that you can customize your own sleep sounds instead of using either refreshing rain or peaceful night. You can Also add different sounds. For me on peaceful night I took out the owl and campfire and traded them for crickets and frogs. Absolutley amazing.,5
"July 31, 2019","Although I cannot deny the fact that some of the options on this app are extremly relaxing, like the ocean setting, this app did have some major flaws. One of the flaws I noticed was the lack of settings, there was a huge lack of diversety so you ended up choosing somthing less than satisfactory. The next flaw I noticed was that it got repetitave with options like ""vintage rain"" or ""rain in a rainforest"" the idea was essentially the same.",3
"November 20, 2019",This app is a miracle maker. Whenever I'm stressed about something I turn to this app and it calms me down. The biggest advantage I would say is that you can customize the sounds - and this without having to pay. I've recommended it to some friends who had trouble falling asleep and the variety of sounds provided by this app helped them. It is so worthy to install Sleep Sounds!,5
"May 10, 2019","I love that you can mix and match the sounds the way you want at the volume that you want. Wind loud, soft creek, little sounds of thunder. Your choice. You can even switch to other apps, even other audio apps and it still keeps playing the sound. Love this app. Calms my anxiety.",5
"January 1, 2019","Very good at helping me get to sleep, especially if there is someone snoring nearby. I can just plug in and chill out. I also like using some of the more lively sounds to help me relax during the day without the threat of falling asleep. Excellent, especially as I have anxiety, this helps me relax a lot. My favourite app 😊",5
"September 19, 2020","Love it but I don't like the new version with ads and a membership subscription... The old version of the app was better. I love the relaxing nature sounds.. they sound really good and you could mix the sounds however you like. There are 4 relaxing sleep songs on here and they are very relaxing and calming, just wish there were more! I rate the original app 5 stars.. but I don't like the new version with ads.",5
"March 11, 2019","It's the best sound generator period... no loops, no skips, no glitches~very smooth. Want proof? Download it and listen to the crickets. That alone is all I would ever need~~it's really that good. Add in the rain and other generous number of sounds, the ability to set a timer, being able to mix sounds and each volume independently, etc. makes this (in my humble opinion - which I'm entitled to because I researched these for almost a month) the B E S T of the best of the best. Try it out!",5
"November 15, 2019","Calming sounds, great for sleeping, meditating, and reading. Can create custom sounds and adjust volume of each individual sound. Has a timer for sounds to shut off and the sounds gradually fade out, not just end abruptly. I would say this is about the best sleep sound app I have come across, no complaints at all.",5
"March 1, 2021","Used to work well. Now it's full of ads and interrupted sound. UGH! It will randomly stop playing and wake me up. So disappointing. Update to my update. Now the app crashes after certain number of hours and forces you to run another ad. Basically, it is trying to force the user into paying for a subscription. Not a good look. I've used this app for a handful of years now. It used to function perfectly. All I get now is interrupted sleep and annoyance.",1
"March 20, 2020","I don't usually bother to review apps, but honestly, I love this. I love how many options there are, what said options are, and how customizable everything is. Some people seem to be having issues with it stopping and starting, but I personally haven't (might be a phone age thing, mine is less than 6 no the old and this app runs well). Ads aren't annoying, just one before the sounds start and they won't randomly pop in later unless you change the sound, so I honestly don't mind them.",5
"October 16, 2019","I've been using Sleep Sounds to help ease me to sleep. I tend to have issues winding down & it works for me. I like it better than other sleep sounds apps because it's sounds clear realistic and the volume can be adjusted fairly high without being too loud, if needed; due to external interference. I'm sleeping better since I began using it.",5
"March 11, 2019","I love this app! I need some sort of noise when going to sleep and this app provides so many options of different soundscapes to lull you to sleep. I especially adore the custom made option, where you can mix and match all different kinds of soundscapes to create the best white noise. And always, it's free! Which makes the app even better.",5
"January 10, 2020","This app is truly the best free sound app for sleep. It helps me fall asleep every night and has for over a month now. Music doesn't cut off the audio from this app, so if I want some of my favorite classical music, I can have both play at once. This has helped me for at least two weeks of a given month. I use this constantly and it is by far my favorite sound app ever. If you're wondering whether to get this or not, do it!! You won't regret it. Listen to the 4.8 star rating!",5
"October 27, 2020","I love that you can add or subtract sounds from the main one; such as the ""rain on leaves"" I like to add wind and thunderstorm sounds, and it does sound like a mild rain storm is outside. It has different time limits for auto shutoff or no time limits at all and even keeps playing when my phone shuts off from lack of use!!! Helps get me to sleep and even helps keep me asleep since my brain is focused on these sounds and can ignore the household noises that could wake me up.",5
"December 5, 2018",I love this app. I love the fact that there is a timer to set and I usually set it at 30 minutes and I fall asleep way before it stops. I also appreciate the ability to change the different subsounds with each main sound and that you can control the volume. Every night is a different sound configuration to me and I enjoy finding what works for me or doesn't work for me.,5
"September 3, 2019","This is without a doubt my favorite sleep app. I' ve tried about 5 before, but I uninstalled them once I found this. I've recommended it to several insomniacs. I love how you can layer one of the 25+ sounds over the other, to make it personal. So many different options! The first night I used this, I slept 9 hours!",5
"September 4, 2019",This is the most amazing app I have!! Alot of different locations and sounds that you can add to create your own particular sound. Also customize all sounds at once and a easy timer to set. This really helps me to fall asleep so quickly and restful. I highly recommend this app you will not be disappointed!!! Give it a try...😴😴👍😊💤💕,5
"March 12, 2019",This app is exactly what i am looking for. It has many preset options to quickly chose from aswell as the ability to tweak those options and create your own custom combos. It is aesthetic pleasing and very easy to use. What little adds there are in the free version are small and non-obtrusive banners at the bottom of the screen creating no interruptions to the use of the app. I also enjoy the ability to set a timer for the length of time I want the noise to last. I highly recommend this product.,5
"October 8, 2018","Use this almost every night. Simple to use and great features and sounds. I rarely rate and review, let alone pay for an app, this app was an exception. You dont have to pay for it either, but they definitely deserve the $1, and it removes the ads(which arent even annoying at all)",5
"February 23, 2020","Used to love, love love this app so much until the update and now ads take up the whole screen and I am half asleep trying to X out of them to have my favorite sounds start playing. Please fix??? Please??? You have great sounds. Better than my Alexa. I downloaded another sleep sounds app today . . . Thanks! Update: Received a message to remove ads for $50.00. Really? $50? That's absurd. Sorry, no thanks.",2
"January 17, 2020",Love this! It helps me sleep every night. I have a very hard time sleeping and it relaxes me and before I know it I'm out. It has many different sounds and noises. U can add which eva ones u want to any of them. And adjust the sound level. And the best of all is the timer I can set. So I don't have to worry about it going all night or cutting off before I am asleep.,5
"October 28, 2020","Been using for years! Love that it's an app not a machine. I have separate personalized sounds for night and day, so I can play it wherever AND whenever I'm sleeping, cause it's right on my phone. And best part is, because I use it consistently for bed, as soon as it starts playing, my brain says.. Ok! Bedtime! And when I shut it off, my brain switches to waking mode! Love, love, love it!",5
"January 5, 2021","I LOVE this app. I use it every night. It's amazing! It barely ever shows ads, and if they are there it's a small banner at the bottom of the screen. Almost never plays video ads and if it does its always before the sleep sounds and never durring! When I say I use this every day I mean it. I used to use ambient sounds from Amazon, but now that I live some where where I don't have internet this app has saved my sleep",5
"January 5, 2019",love this app. I can increase or decrease the different types of sounds is great. I don't like birds and the fact that I can remove them is Absolutely fantastic! timer function is also greatly appreciated. the many base themes allows for changes so I don't get to use to any particular patterns which is when other similar apps start to fail working for me.,5
"January 15, 2019","I used to only be able to sleep well and quickly when it was raining outside, but I was able to near perfectly simulate what it sounds like outide my window when it rains. Love it! I sleep so much better, and the timer function is really handy so the sound doesn't keep me away from deep sleep.",5
"May 28, 2021","I just love this app. I suffer from chronic insomnia, and I can finally get some quality sleep. It has a nice choice of soothing sounds, and it's really great that you can set a timer as well. I especially love Winter Cottage, Peaceful Night and Ocean. You can also create your own mix, which is awesome. This app is a wonderful, natural way of getting a good night's sleep. Forget sleeping pills, install Sleep Sounds instead.",5
"March 5, 2020","Must have! I tend to have trouble sleeping and spend many sleepless nights searching for apps to solve my problem. But when I found this fantastic app, I created a play list of the perfect sounds that has kept me sleeping since I first downloaded it. Thank you to the developers of this app that really hears the voice of the sleepless and bestows a flawless app that I would recommend to anyone. This is a must have!",5
"June 13, 2020","Really nice app with a large variety of sound options to choose from, plus it's simple and easy to use. The app does randomly shut off, though that doesn't happen often. My second issue is that the app will continue to run even if the phone isn't being charged. I've had a few times where my phone died in the middle of the night because it stopped charging for some reason, but the app kept running. Would be nice to have an optional setting that auto closes the app if the phone stops charging.",3
"March 2, 2020","A great app to play before you sleep, i use it every night with headphones to block out sound and relax. The variety of sounds is great, not to mention the option to make a combination of them and adjust each of their volumes accordingly. You won't find a better noise machine app.",5
"August 16, 2019","A very nicely thought out sound generator. Customizable to generate soothing, relaxing, and reassuring sounds to lull one to sleep or calm anxiety, or to meditate to. A built-in timer controls duration, but it can also play indefinitely. A very useful tool. I might like a few more sounds available, or to be able to add my own favorite sounds, but overall a delightful app.",5
"August 19, 2020","I'm still using these sleep sound app. It doesn't have nearly as many sounds and sounds mixes as some of the other apps I've come to use. However i enjoy this one because the play-back loop is very hard to catch. Where in other apps that's one of my soul reason for installing. I hope that aren't done and plan to add sounds and upgrades, if so I'll keep it for a while",4
"January 7, 2020","Excellent App. I had bought a sound machine for my child's room but it was obnoxious sounds! I am so glad I downloaded this to my phone for traveling. I like how it can mix sounds and add or diminish a particular sound. Also, has great mixes already made that you can alter to your liking. I wish this one was available for apple products as I have an iPad I would like install this app on.",5
"November 18, 2019","I use this app every night as a white noise machine. The sounds seem very real and there is no discernible loop that I can tell. You can mix in various elements like crickets and rain drops. Really love this ap. UPDATE: ap suddenly blocked unless I ""agree"" to a very long and involved privacy policy and tos that I didn't have to agree to initially. This is a white noise generator, not Facebook. I agreed to the initial permissions. Why are we changing that up now all of a sudden?",2
"October 31, 2018","This app is new for me - but I've used it enough to vouche that it is just lovely. It is so refreshing to be able to customize everything! I just discovered that I can build my own 'song', and decided I had to write my FIRST EVER review. Keep up the good work guys, I hope you add some more options in the future!",5
"March 11, 2020","This is a pretty good app. There are many sounds to choose from and good options for customization. The biggest issue is that the sound turns off every night when I'm using it. It goes off or pauses after a short while but the timer keeps running. I usually set my timer for 6 hours because of the noise around my apartment but when I wake up in the middle of the night I have to press play to restart the sound, even though the timer is still counting down. Happens every night since the last update",3
"April 15, 2019",Really love it! I am pleased with the fact that i can go to the different settings and add or delete whatever sounds i want and how loud i want those sounds ex the crickets sound can be like you're sitting in a field of crickets or you can turn it down and they sound more distant....I appreciate the sleep timer the most so it doesnt just keep playing once im asleep.....You should def get this app 💖😴,5
"October 12, 2018","I decided to pay up $1 within 5 minutes of playing around with the app. I'm very impressed with the clean and simple interface, plus the ability to mix different sounds. I'd to request a feature: please let us save our favorite presets. With the freedom to create custom presets, it makes sense to let us keep the different ones we enjoy instead of having to go back and fiddle with the picks and volumes every night. Thank you.",5
"May 7, 2021","This app is AMAZING! As somebody that doesn't fall asleep easily, I can definitely say this app really helps. You can turn your phone off, and the music/sound still plays! You can also play the sound even when you're not In the app. You can even make custom sounds! (Actually, while I'm writing this review, I'm listening to my custom sound!) This app also helps for studying, or you can just listen to the sounds and relax! My favorite sound is definetly relax. Anyways, 1000/10, definetly recommend",5
"October 21, 2019",I am honestly impressed by the versatility of the sounds and the ability change the level of the sounds. You can even make your own mix which is fun to experiment with. I use this app if I have a really hard time sleeping. It helps. The thunder in the rainstorms are my favourite ones.,5
"January 15, 2021",Probably my favorite app. So glad there's a timer and I use it when my husband isn't in the bed due to his insomnia. Keeps me calm and doesn't wake me through the night. Update: (1/14/21) Kindof sad there are so many ads now and there is a subscription (not mandatory but still). I clicked off two sounds under custom added one and an ad started playing. Which is a real bummer and annoying. I really love this app but that is a con for me. I do like the new layout! Looks really nice!,5
"February 20, 2019","its awesome just what i need to get to sleep and the timer function is amazing. the only thing i dont like is rhe vintage train, if they changed it to a modern sounding train it would be better suited for me personally. i do wish they had a few more low frequency sounds, but the app itself is amazing and works perfectly.",5
"January 18, 2019","Excellent app in every aspect that could be or that has been considered. Finally, something that actually HELPS. Highly recommend app to download, you will not regret it. I use this app every time I need to relax and I will not miss a night without it... And neithwr will you once you have it to use yourself. 100% wonderful. The app I have been waitimg for, for what seems like forever! I CAN FINALLY R-E-L-A-X...",5
"May 10, 2019","This app has helped me so much. I love how you can create your own mix or you can choose a premade mix. The timer option is really helpful. I don't really like to wake up and still hear it so that helps me. I can't sleep in complete silence so this is useful. I was looking for a free, create your own, plays out of the app, app. This is perfect for people who have trouble sleeping",5
"October 16, 2019","I love this app so much. I work nights so once i get home its light outside so it can be hard to sleep. But having this app is amazing. Being able to pick sounds but also make your own is amazing, being able to put timers on the sounds is amazing. I can't sleep without it now💜💜💜",5
"August 1, 2021",Good and relaxing . You can open another apps like mp3's youtube facebook with this and still playing you will enjoy the sound of nature while uSing Another Apps at the same time.,5
"January 12, 2019","Very helpful. Best thing is you can create your custom sounds by mixing different animals/environments and also you can set a timer. What I do is I set a timer for 1 hour, go to bed, grab a book, read for a while and then go to sleep and let it run in the background. Extremely good app.",5
"August 1, 2020","This is the BEST sleep app ever! You can customise each soundscape, every sound is realistic, as if actually recorded, rather than synthesised. There's a really good variety of lovely real nature sounds too. The background colours are soothingly dark as well, so the light doesn't wake you up if you want to look at it . It'll go on playing all night if you want it to, you can even set a timer. Great attention to detail. Better than paid subscription apps! Your forced to watch ads but whatevs!",5
"October 19, 2019","Sleep sounds has made me fall asleep so much faster. I used to have like a million thoughts running through my head and THIS makes me fall asleep within the 5 nineties of listening to it. It's so nice how you can pick a sound and add more to it, or less. And you can also use a timer.",5
"July 2, 2021","I've always had a hard time falling asleep, even with taking medication I could lay in bed for hours trying to get to sleep. Honestly since the very first night listening to Sleep Sounds I am asleep within an hour and much more relaxed! And being able to customize to my liking is an dream! I would recommend this App to anyone and everyone, oh wait...I am! Lol",5
"October 21, 2018","This app has really helped with my minor insomnia. It has a nice range of both nature and man-made sounds. It also allows you to customize what you hear. Don't like thunder with your rain but want birds chirping? No problem. It also has a timer so you don't have to turn it off. All in all, a great app!",5
"December 20, 2021","Very relaxing app, I listen to different sounds all the time for relaxation 😌",4
"January 13, 2020","it's free, hasn't glitched on me yet and offers a lot of cool random background noises (more than the usual basic options) and you can add extra noise. for example if you like to hear rain falling but with owl noises and add crickets or frogs. you can adjust the add on noises like if you want the rain to be the loudest and have the owls at medium volume and the frogs croaking super low. you can adjust it which is rad. you can set a timer for 30mins to +hours play until you sleep.",5
"January 30, 2020","I have always had issues falling asleep. I have to have noise, but leaving the TV on didn't always work, and it disturbs others around me. This app, however, lets me customize sounds and duration, so I can get the right amount and kind of noise, and it shuts off in a reasonable amount of time. It's so much easier to get to sleep now.",5
"December 1, 2018",I love this app! I like how it gives me options for sleeping. I also really like the fact that it let's me add other noises to the main one I'm using. My favorite option is the vivd creek one. I would also like new options if that is possible. Over all I really love this app so much.,5
"February 1, 2020","I'm a terrible sleeper, 1st night using this app & I was out like a light in minutes & stayed asleep all night. I love the option of adding difference sounds. I love the sound of trains, it's no wonder that I fell asleep immediately. I'd love to hear some train whistles though, could you ad some to the app? Great app. Keep up the good work.",5
"July 30, 2019","Wow, I always have had a difficult time falling asleep. I've tried meds, sleep hypnosis apps, you name it. Then I tried this app and used the Refreshing Rain sound, which I customized by adding the rain hitting the roof along with the fire one, which was like an outdoor camp fire crackling sound. I was out like a light in about 10 minutes max, maybe less. I will be using this app every night now. I even had a fun dream! Definitely worth it! I never got charged $ either like others seemed to.",5
"December 9, 2018","This app is by far the best Zen I have ever come across. I love how you can add animal noises, nature sounds, vehicle noises, and music. There are endless combinations a person could make. My little boy and I love this app so much. It's not just for sleep in our house!",5
"November 14, 2018","Love the app very simple to use. I used every night for sleep and it actually help me to fall asleep faster. I usually roll over and over trying to get some sleep but this app help me so much even to relax at the office. I will recommend this to anyone with stress, anxiety or imsomnia.",5
"January 10, 2020","I've used this app on every phone I've had. I think it has ads, I can't remember. It keeps them out of the way and makes the user experience simple. The sounds are quality and you can mix and match all of them at any level. My favorite is rain on leaves with soft, distant thunder.",5
"August 24, 2019","This app is brilliant. It honestly has helped me to fall sleep faster and with fewer interruptions in the night. The timer function is great and the best part is it doesn't interfere with any of my mobile alarms. Good job guys, I'm so happy I downloaded this. I've even recommended to friends and loved ones to download too",5
"July 30, 2021",Sounds are very realistic and no adds even though its free! It sets the bar way up for all other apps! Thanks!,5
"July 8, 2019",when I say great app 👌😊. you can set the time of the sounds and your add-ons. ex like the birds or the thunder in the background. You can turn the light off on your phone and still hear the sound. it sounds just like what the picture explains. I love the rain so i set it for 15mins and the thunder came in every 40 secs i feel asleep so fast my legs was so restless and they were relaxed like 1min in. Im not a Doctor but you should try this app if you are upset it should relax you for sure.,5
"November 25, 2019","Perfect compromise with my dude and I. I usually sleep with the TV on (ever since I was little I HAVE to have sound), I can't sleep without it... but my dude can't sleep with it on. This app? This works for me perfectly, and even he likes it. 🙂 I love the preprogrammed themes (Relax, Reflection and Calm are my favs), but I also love that we are given each sound individually and can make it whatever we need it to be (make sure to slide through the screens or you'll miss that feature).",5
"April 3, 2020",I was happy to pay a few euros for the ad-free version under my old Google account. I refuse to pay a monthly subscription for an app that now has full-screen pop-up ads AND asks me to order a paid subscription before I've even used it. Over 25€ a year for some background noises? No thanks. Another app ruined by the developer getting greedy. All the sound apps from this developer used to be great. All of them are shameless cash-grabbing rubbish now. Uninstalled.,1
"January 26, 2021","I've used this app for a long time and really enjoyed it. I just looking at my apps though and noticed it looked different... a visual upgrade? Cool! Except with that upgrade there are now ads that play before you can listen to your white noise. You know what's great for sleep? Having a long, loud, bright app blasted in your face before you close your eyes. I will be uninstalling and finding an app that doesn't assault me with ads right before bed.",1
"December 5, 2018","I love this app and all the sound combinations you can make. I like that the advertising does not get in the way of the use of the app. I would like it if they added a fan sound and white noise. I like it if my sound is constant like the rain. When it fluctuates and the sound increases it makes me more alert. I love the sound of ocean waves, but I can't sleep to them because the sound fluctuates. But, that's just me.",5
"September 24, 2020","Was great, but ads have gotten intrusive. The last thing I want before I fall asleep is to hear an ad play when I'm just trying to turn on some white noise. These full screen pop up ads on a timer are not appropriate for this kind of app. It was annoying before but now the ads have sound so I'll be deleting this app. Maybe I can find another free app without these annoying types of ads.",2
"August 6, 2021",Love that i can customise my own sound. Wonderful for helping me get to sleep after night shifts or when I'm just struggling to get to sleep.,5
"December 24, 2019","Love this app. I hate total silence so I use it not only for sleep but while reading or bathing too. Especially appreciate the fact that I can combine and adjust the volume of sounds to my own preferences. I did purchase the premium bits, it's worth the extra couple bucks.",5
"October 21, 2018","the sounds are so-so, I only liked the rain and fireplace. night sounds like someone blows a whistle blown exactly every second. the worst is that after a few minutes of playing the sounds suddenly stop and I cannot hear anything if I don't restart the app. tried a few times, every time the same - after few minutes sudden silence.",2
"June 7, 2020","I love this app!! It's super easy to use and I really enjoy that I can customize the sounds to my liking. I like that I can use 3 different sounds at once but I can make certain sounds louder and softer at the same time. My favorite is Peaceful Night and I add in crickets, rain on umbrella and pink noise. I have the crickets a touch louder, then the pink noise a tad softer and then the rain on umbrella just barely noticeable. By far the best sleep sound app out there!!!",5
"April 17, 2019",Just love this app. Within no time I'm away with the fairies. I love that you can customise your slumber sounds to whatever suits you. Don't hesitate to install this app if you struggle to nod off at bedtime. You won't be struggling too much longer....,5
"April 26, 2020","When I downloaded the app, the first thing I saw was a membership/costings page. But once I exited that page, I had access to a variety of different sounds ( I was feeling drowsy within 5 mins of testing them). Would give it a 5, but the wolves sound doesn't work/there are some adverts. Other than that, it's easy/straightforward to navigate and lots of options for a free user like me!",4
"February 9, 2021","The free version is no longer worth having. You can't have full screen video ads on a relaxation app 🤦 I've used it for a long time and would pay for an upgrade, but not $2.99 /a month/. I also would have responded to a ""please donate"" prompt! or they could have just locked certain features or had dark banner ads. The inclusion of video ads makes the app unusable for its intended purpose and I'm not signing up for another subscription service",1
"July 1, 2021","I was going to give this a try, as I was having a hard time falling asleep. This managed to do the complete opposite and wake my partner up with a LOUD ADVERTISEMENT. I understand free versions have ads, but when I feel like I'm being bullied into paying, I immediately uninstall.",1
"May 2, 2020","Great app. Minimal ads. Lost one star because it doesn't sound as good as I expected. Maybe headphones or Bluetooth speakers would help, because the speaker on this Samsung Galaxy A30 is worse than rubbish. I had no idea any phone company would release a phone with such a useless speaker. Also, volume only changes on the highest 3 settings or so, making 75% of the volume options unusable. If I knew this before I bought it, I'd buy a different phone.",4
"March 23, 2021","I fell in love with the sound mixing and quality. I deleted it 3 minutes later. VERY LOUD ads. Idc about ads, but not running ads on silent on an app that's supposed to help people sleep seems like the easiest UIX decision ever. Instead I got SUPER startled and hit uninstall as fast as I could. Seriously, did no one shop this with actual insomniacs before releasing it this way?",1
"January 9, 2019","It's rare I feel the desire to send feed back on an app but really rate this! it's lovely and straightforward, simple & accessible, and you can tweak it to you're personal preferences with ease! timer is a fab addition, but mostly love it's interactive abilitys! one of the better free apps out their. 10/10.",5
"September 26, 2019","Very soothing. Been using for the past 2 weeks to help with insomnia. The customization is great, especially since after I fall asleep, I tend to be a light sleeper. No waking do to sudden shifts in volume, and lots of different sounds to choose from. Five stars!",5
"May 25, 2019","Very relaxing. I looked at a couple others but this one was easy to use and very relaxing. Easy to customize with different sounds. And when using the timer, it doesn't just suddenly cut off when done but slowly fades out, making it a more peaceful way to wake up.",5
"November 18, 2021",keeps turning off on its own,3
"October 10, 2019","Worked great at first. Loved all the different sound options and the ability to set it on a timer. BUT since the latest update, the sound has been shutting off randomly even though the timer is still going. Causes me to wake up in the middle of the night now instead of working great like it used to.",3
"March 1, 2019","Awesome app. Good quality sound, with precise custom volumes for each effect. Can be set on a timer so the app isn't running the whole night. Will run in the background. Wide variety of relaxing sounds to choose from. Highly recommended for people who like ambient noise for studying, sleeping, relaxing, etc.",5
"January 5, 2020","Great options on sounds. Music, animals, vehicles, weather. Love that you can overlap sounds and change the volume of each sound individually. Also live the timer feature. Helps me know how long it took me to fall asleep the night before.",5
"January 6, 2021","Fantastic app! I play it most nights and it helps me relax. I fall asleep faster and feel like I get better rest. And it also helps drown out outside noise. Doesn't kill the battery on my phone like other apps I've used. I would say maybe 30-40 percent in after 8 hours of use. And even then, it's usually plugged in when I use it so that's not really a problem. I've been using it for almost a year and I love it!",5
"October 12, 2018","This is a surprising delightful app. Surprising because you can add sounds together to get just the right noise for sleeping or meditation. I use the Harp as I read the Bible. It is not only delightful, I think it is anointed like the Harp David played for King Saul in the Bible. It clears your mind to study!",5
"October 5, 2018","As someone who struggles with frequent insomnia, this app is a wonderful tool to help me relax enough to get to sleep. The customizable options let me create the perfect white noise for my needs, and the timer ensures I don't miss my alarm in the morning. Highly recommend",5
"January 17, 2019",oh wow where have you been!! downloaded this last night and its my new best friend. the apps easy too use and you can customise it too you which is totally awesome 😍. you can set a timer so its not running all night absolutely brilliant. who ever made this program thank you !!! i got 8 hours sold sleep and feel so refreshed today! my job is high maintenance so my mind struggles to shut off but yep i did last night first time in months! 😁😁😁,5
"June 10, 2021","If i could give zero stars, i would. When it works, my goodness it works well! But when it shuts off at random, wakes me immediately up, and I have to turn it on again and again and again, it really ruins what little sleep i get. This has been going on for a few months. Sometimes it works all night long for a few days, sometimes it freezes and quits 1 to 4 times per night. Fix this please 🙏",1
"January 15, 2020",This app has been amazing in helping me get to sleep at night. Great variety of sounds to select from and live the fact i can set timers on the music. Only thing I haven't liked is that you can only add 3 ambient sounds to each track would be better if i could add as many as i wished. But highly recommend the app to anyone with sleep issues,4
"April 13, 2019",I have been using this app for a few months now every night to help me fall asleep. I tried one night without it and I must say I love to hear the sounds I have chosen. I am slowly coming off sleeping pills with the help of this app and other natural tablets/drops its a slow process but I feel calmer when I settle into my sleep routine now. Thank you.,5
"March 30, 2020","Love this app! I had trouble sleeping but the music in this app helps me wind down and fall asleep. I really love how you can customize the different sceneries with other sounds like rain, crickets, crackling fire Etc. You can also put a timer on the music so it doesn't play all night until you wake in the morning.",5
"July 8, 2019","Moved into an apartment and while I had no trouble sleeping, my husband did because of noise from outside cars and people upstairs. So we found this app, and not only does it help him sleep more soundly, but I found I actually enjoy it. I like coming up with different sound combos, and waking up wit",5
"April 23, 2019","it helped me sleep 10x better. And I've been needing more sleep. It usually takes me about an houe to fall asleep. Now i fall asleep in less than 20 minutes. But some sounds honestly were not relaxing, and did not sound like the actual name of the sound. On the bright side even my dog is snoring in 5 minutes.😂",4
"August 2, 2019","Really nice app, all the right sounds for meditation, I was looking for something like that for long time. I love that I can add any desirable sound to the main theme and crate my own favorite soundscape. Birds chirping, winds, water sounds, owl hoot, wolf howl in the winter cottage during a snowstorm with fireplace crackling, perfect",5
"April 4, 2020","So far, so good. I used it for the first time last night and it seems to be pretty good. I appreciate the fact that the song packages can be modified. In my case, I was able to turn off the irritating birds while using the creek sounds. I also like that there are other options available also, especially that we can set a time a limit on what we will be hearing - anywhere from a few minutes to 8 hours and an optional no time limit. Thanks for the resource and the varied sound possibilities.",4
"February 27, 2019","Thank you for being free, there are a lot of sleep time apps out there that want to charge people for some damn samples. The volume sliders for sounds are amazing, as well as being able to make any combination you want. Very user friendly as well. Great job.",4
"March 6, 2019","I love it. You can customise it easily, it runs in the background and you can even play other audio simultaneously and the ads are super discrete and not a hassle at all! The only thing I so not like soo super much is the wind noise... It sounds odd to me but the rest is super nice and relaxing.",5
"August 15, 2019","I absolutely love this app! It's one of my top five favorite apps. However, the one thing I could think of to make this app better is... custom sets...! You can already have custom sounds together but I think it would be eveb better with sets that you can create and save for yourself :)",5
"March 17, 2020","This app is great! The best sleep sound app I've used so far. I think the only thong that could make it better, is if it had a softer thunder option. The two it offers are very booming and loud, I'd really love if there was a rolling or distant thunder noise. But other than that, a very good app, I use it every single night.",4
"January 2, 2021","Love the pre-set options and the many independent outdoor sounds that allow me to mix-and-match to create a soothing environment that I can relax, meditate, and fall asleep to. Love this app! I've tried others but always found them lacking the pleasant specific sounds that this app offers. Hands down, this is my go-to app for sleep sounds!",5
"February 22, 2020","The banner ad at the bottom of the screen has an x to close which is actually linked to buying their ad free version. This would be fine but this lines up perfectly with the ""confirm order"" button and if you're trying to close the dialog it ends up charging you £46.99!! For a sleep app! I got a refund but this is unbelievably dishonest",1
"August 7, 2021",It's an amazing app it's the only sleep sound app I have. I literally fall asleep in like 15 minutes :) and i only use the brown noise but with the white and pink together,5
"August 14, 2019","Great app, I especially like being able to add in sounds. The crickets sound is so soothing. We used to have lots of crickets, but no more. Running the crickets sound made me realize how much I miss the little critters. Thanks for this bit of heaven!",5
"October 18, 2019","A very good app for sleeping noises, it helps calm me down so I can sleep, and it has no bugs nor much problems. However, I just can't give it 5 stars due to it just not having enough sounds, the app could really use some fan noises or white noise to give more diversity. Overall, good app",4
"January 5, 2019","love the different sounds you can play, I add music to them all as it helps me sleep. however when you put a timer on, it'll still be playing when I wake up with the timer now off. not ideal but not the end of the world. would've been 5 stars if it didn't do this.",5
"March 17, 2020","Works well. No audio ads like some have! Use nightly. I especially like that you can change how loud, or remove, individual sounds from the different options. For instance, if the bird call in a ocean sound was too much for you, you have the option of making the bird call quieter or turn it off.",5
"August 16, 2021","Loved this until they started playing loud, annoying ads recently. Time to look for a new sleep app.",2
"November 27, 2019","First time using I fell right to sleep!!! Multiple choices! You can tweak the sounds on each sound choice to customize your selection, but not necessary. Very easy to use and you can go to Settings and choose how long you want it to play. Using on older extra phone, Samsung Galaxy S5, and no problems.",5
"April 19, 2021","I love this app. I use it daily to relax and sleep. The free version of the app offers a variety of soothing sounds with minimal ads, and nonstop playing throughout the night. I've gotten a lot of my android-owning family hooked on the app; My family with iOS wish this app was available on the Apple Store because they've noticed how great it is!",5
"July 10, 2019","i really love this app. i like relaxing music to help me to fall asleep, i do listen to the same one each night, i can set it to play for 4 hours ( or more) which is great for me because sometimes i can take a while to go to sleep, i also suffer tinnitus and the music helps me to be less aware of the electricity wire noise in my ear 10/7/19 i am continuing to use this app every night without fail, i can't get over finally finding an app that gives me what i am needing, just love it",5
"November 3, 2018","WOW - now that I have found all the features of this app, I had to come back and say how wonderful it is. You have complete control and can mix whatever sounds that suit you and your mood. I am a shift worker and have to sleep at odd hours day and night. The app is easy to use and I highly recommend it.",5
"July 3, 2019","I love this app. It helps me sleep most nights. Because of my insomnia, it helps me to fall asleep faster and it provides background noise which drowns out the constant ringing/static I hear 24/7. only sometimes will the app just stop playing the audio, and that gets annoying but it's not frequent enough for me to give a lessened rating.",5
"February 18, 2020","Unable to sleep. 1 or 2 hours a night thinking about issues in work and in personal life. Unable to function, and spiraling. Tried putting the tv on to drown out the thoughts but there is always a noise with anything you watch to stop the drifting off. The rain on the window with thunder tap with a 40 min timer is the one. I thought the thunder would stop me drifting but the mix of rain and occasional thunder to stop my thoughts wandering was amazing Thank you",5
"September 24, 2019","Absolutely love this app for bedtime. Helps me relax after a long day at school. Also use it for studying when I have big exams coming up. The only problem I have with it is there is no regular rain, it has rain on windshield and another rain that sounds like its hitting a tin roof lol. But great app guys keep it up.",5
"December 8, 2018","Amazing!! Got me threw a lot of sleepless nights. I think it would be even better to allow the flash to go off every time the crack of thunder sounded to mock lightening. That would be amazing!!! But the sounds are so realistic, I love it!!",5
"April 23, 2020",I work crazy shifts as a CNA and have had serious trouble sleeping. This app puts me right to sleep. Thoroughly enjoy the fact that it has multiple timing options. Perfect for toddlers too. Puts my baby cousin who is 3 to sleep as well. Almost like magic. He prefers the serenity while I like the white noise. All sounds are good for sleep. You just need to listen to what works with your breathing and heart rate.,5
"October 24, 2018",Absolutely love the sounds and things you can also personalise your sound with. I have used a sound machine for a few years. This app is absolutely better though as it has more selections to choose from. I suffer with tinnitus so this takes my mind of the buzzing. Would fully recommend this app.,5
"April 3, 2019","Nice user interface. Only reason not 5 stars is because of annoying loud skips with volume change when the sounds loop. Uses less battery life than other white noise apps I've tried. Tried it for a few more days: Updated it to 4 stars. Could be 5 stars, but app uses too much battery life. Turns out the issue with skipping was due to the Bluetooth speaker I was using. Tried another Bluetooth speaker and the skipping stopped.",4
"August 12, 2019","Realy cool. I have used it a lot and its just so peaceful! there are lots of sounds and they all sound pleasant and peaceful, and you can place a time for when you want the sounds to stop like for one hour or some thing like that, you can even customize your time. excellent app, very pleased!😊",5
"August 21, 2019",The app has a simple and easy to use interface. There are many options for varying sounds and each with the ability to add aditional sounds which makes for many combinations. The sounds come off as being natural and dont sounds muffled or extremely edited. All in all an excellent app!,5
"June 14, 2019","I love this app. I use it every night .... for years I tried using meditation tapes and classical music to help with insomnia but I'd be awake so long I'd hear the repetitions...this app does away with that. Use it with mini pillow speakers, you'll be glad you did.",5
"February 15, 2019",I use the Winter Cottage selection every night to fall asleep. I turn down the volume of the fire crackle and turn the wind up to max. The sounds of sleet against the window and a heavy winter wind works for me. I use the timer and it runs an hour. Love it.,5
"August 3, 2021","Loving the sounds especially the customizing features 😍, since I had this app I can sleep for hours, I no longer suffer from Insomnia as much.",5
"March 28, 2019","I love this app! It really helps me get to sleep. I mostly use the rain and wind sounds, and the train sound is great when sleeping on the train. I have also used the custom settings with all the instruments to relax me during massage. Great app!",5
"July 14, 2020","Ok. I go to rate it and it automatically thanks me for 5 stars! Whoa wait a minute! I will give it 4. It's the people who rate things, not the apps themselves. But anyway.......I really like this app. The sounds are very realistic AND clear. It's not a recording of a recording. The relaxation sounds are amazing and the variety is bomb. Thank you for all your efforts and keep it up.",4
"October 9, 2021",Pretty good composition to other sleep apps,4
"May 27, 2020","So good! Every sound is customizable, so i can be listening to gentle rain (a nice rain, not super loud and distorted) with the faint sound of wind in the background while sitting by the fire, also with a couple of night birds thrown in there for added effect. Couldn't recommend more! Please never change, unless you're adding more sounds!",5
"January 14, 2020",was my favorite app until they added Ads👎 i love the sound options they offer. i literally use this app everyday for myself and also my 5 yr old as we both struggle with insomnia. it works wonders!! PLEASE PLEASE get rid of the ads !! i love this app but the ads WILL force me to find another . although i really like this one. would have gave it 5 stars but the ads are extremely DISSAPOINTING and constantly interrupt!!,3
"January 13, 2019","I see some negative ratings, but have a hard time believing it's anything more than angry people who need more than some app assisted help sleeping. App is fantastic Been using for around 6 months. Features work like a charm and I really like that many sound options have several, customizable/optional components. Don't want crickets in your rain forest? Turn them off! Or change them to purring cats. I'm especially fond of using the cave's drip sounds and adding campfire. Great app.",5
"September 16, 2018",I love this app helpfully when I'm tired and just wanna go to sleep and when I just need to relax and just chill. My personal favourite is the ocean one with piano 1.you also have a time limit on it where you can set how many minutes you want it on for until it stop playing the music. The only downside the that there aren't much options of music you can't chose from but other than that it's a great app,4
"November 29, 2018","The sounds are wonderful. I love that you can program what you want and set a timer, but lately it's been coming on in the morning too and I don't know how to stop it! It makes me want to sleep! I don't need to hear crickets and frogs before my alarm goes off. It makes my body think it's still dead of night.",3
"February 4, 2020","This app is phenomenal. I didn't realize there was an option to customize your own sleep sounds, I love this feature. I use this at home and when I travel which gives me consistent sounds as I drift off to sleep no matter where I lay my head to rest.",5
"October 22, 2018","I really enjoy this app for the custom sounds, and how its offline. And I now feel more rested when I wake up in the morning for school. If there's any anyway to improve the app I would say just add more custom sounds involving water, wind, and vehicles",5
"February 27, 2019","Great app, works perfectly and does exactly what it should. Includes loads of interchangeable sounds and all of them are high quality and easy to adjust. Used it a lot for the past few weeks and it's helped my sleep pattern so much in that time.",5
"October 2, 2019","It's great to see that this app still exists and still has the same sounds that they had before. I had this app when I had anxiety from my bad neighborhood in the past, and I had trouble sleeping, scared of what is going to happen. I had this app which helped me fall asleep and go in my happy place. I am happy of my life now and just now installing this just to see if anything's new. Probably it could still help me.",5
"September 25, 2018","I absolutely love this app, sends me off to sleep every night and helps to bloke out the noise of my neighbours. I love the fact that you have so many choices of soothing sounds and that you can edit them to suit you. Definitely recommend!",5
"January 29, 2021","Initially loved and gave 5 starts, 2 now after the update. App welcomed me with a payment screen that had a weird way of getting out of, and then shortly after the fullscreen, nonskippable, 20second (white!) ads. Used it for a long time, already downloaded a new app. A warm advice to the product team - you need to invest more time/money into the UX and user testing with a proper target group because this pre-bedtime experience is terrible. UI being prettier does not exempt. Cheers!",2
"September 18, 2020","I have mild Sleep Apnea and I didn't do well with The CPAP. Since I started Sleep Sounds I don't take so long to fall asleep. I'm sure many other people find getting to sleep difficult as we tend to think about daily stresses and negative thoughts. When I listen to my favorite sounds I fall asleep within 5-10 minutes. Love this app. My teenage son and my elderly mother say ""It works!"" I highly recommend it. Sweet Dreams!",4
"November 20, 2019","These are realistic sounds. I go to sleep listening to rain on a window in the summer - sometimes w/distant thunder. In the winter I listen to the wind w/snow hitting a window and a cozy fireplace. Both sounds of the seasons make me feel relaxed and happy to be in my own comfortable bed - out of the ""weather!""",4
"November 5, 2019","I really enjoy this app. I am one of those obsessive thinkers and can't shut my brain off at bedtime, but this app gives me a wonderful bedtime meditation background. After just a couple of nights I am able to quiet my mind and fall asleep easily.",5
"June 10, 2020","I have two problems when it comes to sleep. 1 i get a lot of anxiety when the motion and noise of the day stops and it's time to sleep 2 my neighbor has a schedule opposite mine and stay up all night being quite loud with their music/tv/talking This app helps solve both problems! I turn it on not too loud and put it by my bed and I'm out! It has such a great array of nature sounds, soothing tones and music, and white noise! I have so many go-to combinations that guarantee a peaceful sleep.",5
"November 15, 2020","Sound customization works well. Sound seems to lack bass frequencies, but this could be a phone speaker issue. Displays third-party banner ads (if no ads, I'd rate 5 stars). Sound stops during phone call and resumes when call is over. Better than others I've tried.",4
"December 17, 2019","This great FREE app is like a mixing board - you can select and blend all sorts of soothing sounds, raising and lowering the volume on each until you're happy. And, it does not require an Internet connection (once installed).",5
"February 4, 2020","Love all the options! I especially like the white noise options and that I can make my own combination of sounds, I have created my special combination that really helps me fall asleep. I also like the timer so it isn't going all night.",5
"January 5, 2020","I cant sleep without some sound till i fall asleep. I usually keep a movie playing on a sleep timer, but that sometimes takes me a while to get fully asleep. I decided to try this app. I have always LOVED thunderstorms, i find them relaxing and enjoyable. The first night i used this all with the thunder sounds, i fell asleep in minutes.",5
"February 27, 2020","Good, but actually think that the sounds are a bit too fast. So there should be a longer gap between the lapping of the waves on the ocean sound etc. Peaceful night is great though and always sends me off to sleep! First night I used this I was stressed and on edge, but I fell asleep within minutes. Good value!",4
"October 1, 2021",Peaceful and relaxing sound helping me to wind down and relax,5
"September 17, 2019","Sounds are good, the fact you can edit them even better, timer function for the sounds great! Problem is the timer doesn't work most of the time, can't count the amount of tunes I've woken in middle of the night to the app still playing or the follow morning! Needs to fix or its other great features will mean nothing and the app will be deleted. Easily 5 stars if timer worked.",1
"February 26, 2021",Fantastic app! I use this app every night and it is a great help toward quietening down my over active mind. I've been able to reduce the dose of my sleep medication by over half! There are many different 'scene settings' to choose from and each of them are customisable too. You can also choose which individual sounds to make louder or quieter within each scene which is fantastic for finding the right sound for you. I would highly recommend this app!,5
"June 13, 2020","A diverse range of soundscapes that can assist with getting to sleep. It takes a little experimentation to find which suits your needs but I love the way that there are adjustment options to add/remove features or increase/reduce the frequency of the extra sounds. I find it a useful and beneficial app, thankyou 😊",5
"March 6, 2019","Brilliant. The app is EXTREMELY user friendly. It lets you use predifined sounds or match them to create your own. The timer is a very handy option, and the app is very easy to manage. The ads are very unobtrusive.",5
"November 30, 2018",What I like about this app is that all of the sound files or very crisp and clear. It functions as it says it will. It works great to drowned out the husband's snoring and to help the three-year-old get to bed and stay sleeping instead of waking up all night.,5
"October 10, 2019","Does the trick for me - there's loads of different sounds and settings, but I like that basic rainfall one. I really like the timer feature too - I *think* it just fades out quietly over a minute or so as time is up, because I've never noticed it turn off abruptly.",5
"April 19, 2019","Sleep Sounds has been awesome, effective in helping me get a sound uninterrupted sleep. I've unsuccessful tried herbal sleeping tablets and tea. The opportunity to select sounds in the app is great. I mix the Ocean sound with harp and trickling water and that's doing the trick for me. I highly recommend Sleep Sounds👍👌😊",5
"July 8, 2019","A lovely app with a good, growing collection of sounds. Useful for sleep or concentration, the ability to mix and match your favourite sounds and create mixes allows for a customisable, relaxing experience. I'd recommend anyone give this a try. The only missing feature that I would like to see added",5
"July 21, 2021","Used it for a fair bit, was great when the ads were just small banners and didn't interfere with any listening, but now they are too much. Hard to justify using an app that forces SUPER LOUD ads as you're trying to sleep. Get they want to force you to subscribe, but paying almost $6 to subscribe for ambient noise? Pay that for YouTube Premium and get more bang for your buck.",1
"October 18, 2019","I JUST LOVE THIS APP SOOOOO MUCH its helped me sleep even faster. Back then it took like 2 hours to fall aslerp, but now it only takes about 30 minutes. Its even helped my toddler niece and nephew sleep better. Plus, all the sounds are free!!!I definitely reccomend downloading this app.",5
"May 31, 2020","Since I was a small child I have resisted bedtime. In my 30s I still find myself unable to switch off/embrace the fact sleep is good, even though a lack of sleep leaves me irritable. To help me to wind down I gave this app a shot. White noise has helped me in my adult years to sleep with less interruption, but I wanted to give the bedtime stories a try. I'm not subscribing, just making do with the free stories but I'm yet to listen to even half of any of them before nodding off. Amazing app ♥️",5
"December 20, 2019","If they can fix the countdown timer bug, then it could be a 5 star app. I set a 1 hr timer, and sometimes that shuts off the sound, and sometimes the sound keeps running and ends up waking me up in the middle of the night.",4
"December 9, 2019",This app allows me to personally customize to my needs at the time. I enjoy being able to select multiple sounds together and adjust the volume of each. It's been helpful to get my three year old to sleep as well...Thanks for that!!,4
"October 18, 2018","I love sleeping through a thunder storm, and with this app I love having control of sounds and intensity! The thunder in more realistic than other apps I've tried and end up installing, this one is not on a constant loop of a single bang of thunder, set my timer and usually asleep in 15 minutes!",5
"February 1, 2020","This app was a happy surprise! The individual programmed sounds from tranquil music, nature and the environment are varied and fairly numerous. But the best thing is you can combine them into a specific sound just for you.",5
"February 8, 2021","Hugely disappointed in the new update. I've legit used this app for years. I even reinstalled it when I switched phones. Great sounds, easy platform. Now it's gotten pushy with the subscription premiums and the loud ad clips. I'm sorry, but—seriously? For a sleep sounds app? Others I've seen have just limited or locked sounds and offered subscriptions as a way out of it. Or offered quiet text ads at the bottom. Do that. Fml. We're trying to sleep. I'm uninstalling.",1
"December 7, 2021",I really love this app so I gotta get back to this feedback. Thank you there's no paying Method just need to play and listen to it I love this app.,5
"July 1, 2020","I really enjoy this app because of its many features. The sounds are realistic, I can add other layers of sound and control their intensity. I can have the sleep sounds on all night or on a timer so it will turn off after it lulls me to sleep. I highly recommend this app. It even works on my old phone.",5
"September 13, 2018","In my classes, We are aloud to listen to music as long as we aren't playing on our phones, so I put my ear buds in and listened to these for the first time, Apparently I started getting drowsy and tired, and i ended up falling asleep in class, that night put this on and its helping me sleep, so i must say, thank you so much for this master piece",5
"May 22, 2019","this app is an actual god send. I cant sleep in silence but I can't fall asleep to a movie I rely on youtube for sleep sounds like rain but they never have what I want. I have very specific taste. YouTube also over heats my phone when it's on for 8+ hours, plugged in, and playing audio. I try to use Pandora but the ads wake me up. 11/10 would recommend",5
"November 19, 2019","App was great until the ""upgrade"". I have it set with no timer so it runs all night, but it always shuts off at some point. Didn't do this before. As usual, another case of something being ""fixed"" that wasn't broke! Time to find a different app.",2
"September 12, 2019",I love this app. Lots of sounds to choose from and each can easily be customised. Timer is a great feature too. Only a couple of times have I found that the sound disappears before the timer finishes and then comes back.,5
"November 5, 2019","Absolutely LOVE this app I have had it for about 2 months now and I use it every single night, I suffer from insomnia and as soon as I started to use this app I've been able to fall asleep alot quicker and get an Amazing nights sleep. So thank you to whoever made this app, keep up the great work.",5
"June 23, 2019","I love this app, we use it for everything from listening to it a we go to sleep at night to nap to for our Grandtwins. it's so soothing, very easy to navigate and I love how you can choose every add on to any select and turn the sound up and down on each one individually.",5
"December 5, 2018",I was trying to find something to help me break the bad habit of watching TV before I fall asleep. This app is so relaxing I'm asleep in minutes. I really like the timer feature too so I don't have to wake back up just to turn it off. The app and sound quality were better than I was expecting.,5
"September 16, 2019","This app has potential to be fantastic. But someone got too greedy. Theirs literally a commercial advertisement each time u click on a different one to check it out. Commercials that are too often, destroys app. And scare off people like me. Just trying to find something to relax and go to sleep too. I'm deleting now.",1
"December 21, 2019",I love the three neighbour unboxing music you scroll down to the bottom that has like like everything's in there like if you've turned it all the way down like all the other sounds you can just listen to the music put on timer and just get yourself relax and take everything out of your brain do you feel calm I put it on just three to four minutes and just breathe get ready for the next day I prefer doing this at bedtime so you don't feel sleepy or if you are a teacher do this at school to calm,5
"September 30, 2018",Amazing app! so easy to customise your own sleep sound and I also love that you can set it on a timer and it will play in the background when you lock your phone. One of the most simplistic yet adaptable apps for sleep i've ever used.,5
"October 5, 2019","The sounds do not seem like recordings of nature, but electronic. (Not real crickets, ocean waves are too fast, etc.) However, there are several choices, and two of them work for me to get back to sleep during the night.",3
"April 23, 2019",Extremely peaceful and nice. I also enjoy how you can customize them and set a amount of time. As someone who has trouble shutting down there brain when it come time to sleep. This is very nice and relaxing to listen to and fall asleep.,5
"February 15, 2021","I really liked it, but my second time using it the rain sound WILL NOT turn off, it plays during phone calls and it drains my battery. It shows it as being off, but it's not. I can turn it down to where I cannot hear it but it's still on and draining my battery. I have to uninstall. Maybe I will check it out another time to see if they have fixed this bug but until then I'm sticking with Abide app.",3
"August 18, 2020","Great app for getting sleepy and then actually going to sleep. Like that you can change out, close, and or add the extra noises. Like that you can also change the volume of each. The only thing I'd, if you close the app, it keeps playing the sounds. Maybe my phone setup. Good job!",5
"August 11, 2021","There are so many ads... and when u click to exit it doesn't exit the ad, rather it takes u to it. Very annoying.",1
"November 17, 2018","The app is good but when I use it, it will be working then the audio will turn like static. Like when you are on the phone and you hear static. It happens when my phone is locked and when it isn't. It only started doing this recently.",4
"June 29, 2020","I've always had a radio on to sleep as long as I can remember. But now I found Sleep Sounds, so no more radio. I love how you can add sounds and create your own sleep sounds. I use crickets, campfire, an owl and lighting. It's so soothing to me. Download the app today, give it a try, you will be hooked!",5
"May 1, 2020","This is amazing. I have struggled with sleep for years and this has helped no end. You can edit the sounds to suit your sleep needs and moods. It is perfect, I use it every night! A little frustrating that adverts will pop up if you change from one to another, but can usually be closed quickly. I love this app.",5
"November 23, 2019","I just wanted an app with sleep sounds. I liked it when I first got it so I paid to remove ads but now I have to agree to a privacy policy to use it. As someone else said, this isn't some social media app so why do I need to agree to it? ""Personal Information includes data such as your name and email address, but is not limited to this information.""",1
"October 30, 2018","I love listening to the rain sounds (the others don't really do much for me). It makes me feel instantly relaxed. What makes this app special is the ability to mix up the sounds as you like, and the sleep timer. Nice background images, too.",5
"March 5, 2019",I honestly use it every night. This was a huge help on our trip to Vegas. I love having it available all the time since it is on my phone. Sometimes I even use it to help me focus for things like reading. Wonderful app with cool adjustable features.,5
"July 31, 2021",It makes me rest deep and easy. I love this app. It is worth every single dime. Very affordable. Perfect for me.,5
"November 9, 2021",It drains my battery a lot just for playing eater sound it drains Whooping 60% battery in 7 hours sleep thats massive after recent update,1
"February 6, 2019","Amazing......😊😊😊. I am a very bad sleeper, and it takes me ages to get to sleep. But after downloading this app and adjusting peaceful night I now fall asleep within the hour timer of the timer I set. I have never had to set it for longer because of not falling asleep. Its a total life saver. xx",5
"March 18, 2020",This is a fairly good app with lots of different choices for sounds. But the problem is all those sounds are not perfectly aligened for a loop. We can clearly feel the sound loop with volume getting lower and then stop for a second and then again the volume rises. It is so annoying.,3
"September 24, 2019","Better than Calm based on price. The app provides soothing sounds, great for distracting a busy mind at night. Customisable sounds - you can even add a harp melody to environment's you've customised. Very easy to use. I highly recommend if you struggle maybe with anxieties or low mood.",5
"November 1, 2018","Many combinable sounds with an adjustable volume for each, independantly, with a timer that doesn't have ads, it's great. My favorite's got to be creek with cave and some harp. This must also help people with tinnitus. I'm a night worker so this helps cover cars and whatnot for me.",5
"June 11, 2021","If I could rate 10 out of 5, I would. This application is absolutely amazing thank you. I have literally used it every day since downloading the application. I run it throughout the night until I wake up in the morning. It really helps one to fall asleep easier and have better quality sleep, especially if you need to block out other sleep disturbances. I have only used refreshing rain, and that's all I needed! But there are so many other options. Thank you again to the developers",5
"October 28, 2019","This is a good app, the sounds are customizable which is great. And it works without failing part way through the night. Wish one could add more sounds to a theme, and maybe some more sound choices. But overall works well and is a good sleep app",4
"September 18, 2020","Edit- The ads ruined this app. I get a free app needs ads but a jarring extra loud 30 second ad when I am almost asleep was the last straw. Finding another app with a 1 time fee, am not going to pay a monthly fee when I can BUY a sound machine. Great basic sound machine app, has white noise which is great for drowning out noisy people on an airplane or noises when traveling.",2
"November 26, 2019","Have been using this for awhile. I love it! I really enjoy the preset sounds, and that you may customize them as you like if should you want too. The latest update did well for the looks and extras! Keep up the nice work",5
"April 25, 2019",Extremely easy to use. Love the mixer function to add extra sounds and the timer to automatically turn it off after I fall asleep. Plenty of variety without overwhelming choices. Perfect. Kids love it too.,5
"October 4, 2018","I love the sound of rain, puts me right to sleep. The timer is great to safe battery use and not have the app running all night. It also plays in the background off app if you want to or when the screen is locked. Just love it!",5
"December 31, 2021",I'm glad to use this app. Very much useful,5
"January 25, 2019","Terrific app! You can add sounds and adjust the volume for each. You can set a timer or just let it play continuously. Screen does not have to be in to play. I don't see any way this app could be improved, perfect as is.",5
"May 26, 2020","Great app. No interruptions at all, and even lets you set a timer. You can customize everything, and even make custom sounds. You can minimize the app, but leaving it open drains your battery VERY quickly. Without being open, but still active, it doesn't drain it nearly as much.",5
"June 22, 2020",What makes this app stand out from the others (at least according to my experience) is that you can actually customize the sounds you want to hear; and the impressive part about this is that the sounds are well timed and they are in perfect harmony with each other. I absolutely love this app!!!,5
"February 20, 2019","The first sleeping app I tried and I am liking it, though I wish there is more different sounds of thunders. I live in the Northeast of India and thunders are very common and sometimes distant thunders storms can lull you to sleep. The favorable loudest sound would be alike to you louder thunder sound.* some times, they occur at a frequency of 1 thunder in 3,4 seconds.",4
"December 11, 2019","I love the sounds I can choose from to help me sleep. I've always had a very hard time sleeping. But, when I use this app, it helps me to sleep much better. My favorite is the calming sounds. I just dislike that, when I click a new sound from within the category I've already chosen, it gives me more options for that sound I choose within that category. Can tell me, I have 30 others within that sound to choose from. But, it don't. I've tried clicking to see several times. It don't work.",4
"December 7, 2018",Best app ever! So easy to use! I'm asleep in minutes! So happy I found it!! I live that it had a timer and you can adjust the volumes on each individual noise! By far the best app for a peaceful nights sleep.,5
